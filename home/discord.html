    <h1>A little Discord</h1>

    <p>
      I host a <a href="https://discord.gg/PmmShtF7WS">hacker
      Discord</a> (1k+ members) designed to expose devs (and myself)
      to the internals of databases, compilers, operating systems,
      browsers, emulators, etc. And to provide a community around this
      kind of exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      More recently this has also expanded to include discussion around
      experienced developers, engineering management, and
      architecture/ops/production systems.
