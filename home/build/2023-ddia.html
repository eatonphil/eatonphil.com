<p>
  From August - October, 2023, I ran a book club meeting in-person
  (mostly) at Bryant Park in Manhattan. 17 local folks responded to my
  initial message about it on Twitter. Between 5-8 of them showed up
  each time. Which was a great showing!
</p>

<p>
  We'd meet up every other week at 9AM in the morning for 30
  minutes. If the forecast was rainy I'd email out a link and we'd
  meet over Google Hangout instead.
</p>
<p>
  It might have been nice to have a permanent indoor meeting location
  but that might have required everyone to buy a coffee and for us to
  hope for space in a cafe, or for us to figure out something more
  complex with NYPL or a local company or something.
</p>

<p>
  Since we'd only meet every other week, the week we didn't meet I'd
  send out an email recapping the last chapter with encouragement and
  a reminder to keep making progress.
</p>

<p>
  The folks who attended were developers and managers mostly in
  backend web development at big and small companies.
</p>

<p>
  It was low-effort and enjoyable and I'd do it again!
