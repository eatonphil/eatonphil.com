  My personal path, a hobbyist, was focused at first on
  interpreters for Brainfuck, Scheme, lower-case forth, and
  lower-case lisp. I had a bit of "formal" undergraduate training
  in one PL course and one compilers course I took before I
  dropped out, but for the most part I hacked on stuff since then
  for fun and education.
</p>
<p>
  After I was confident implementing some of those minimal
  languages, I moved on to minimal versions of Lua,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL and Go; varying between
  implementing AST interpreters, bytecode VMs and native-code
  compilers (via C, LLVM, and x86). Either using the language's
  first-party parser or implementing my own handwritten parser.
</p>

<h4 id="Someblindspots">Some blind spots</h4>

<p>
  I have never implemented garbage collection myself (at best I've
  hooked into the host language's GC, similar to using libgc). I
  haven't implemented register allocation since the college
  compilers course. I haven't implemented JIT compilation. I
  haven't spent very much time targeting Windows or macOS or
  anything other than Linux/x86_64.
</p>

<h3 id="Thepopularityoflispsandforths">The popularity of lisps and forths</h3>
<p>
  You might wonder why so many PL/compiler resources focus on
  languages like lower-case lisp. Basically, parsing more common
  languages is more tedious because they have more syntax. So it
  takes you longer to get a working language implementation
  compared to the sparse syntax of a lisp (or a forth).
</p>
<p>
  Once you get the hang of it with a forth or lisp though it's
  easy to bring that skill to "normal" languages. Although you
  will then need to pick up a technique for handling operator
  precedence (discussed below).
</p>

<h3>Introductory</h3>
<p>
  These helped me out and I think are reasonable to recommend to
  others. The list is not long because I have not explored that
  many broad introductory texts. And many that I did (listed
  further below) I really didn't like.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://norvig.com/lispy.html">Peter Norvig's Lisp in Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal">Make a lisp</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Parsing (operator precedence)</h3>
<p>
  First
  off, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/parser-generators-vs-handwritten-parsers-survey-2021.html">real
    world languages generally don't use parser
    generators</a>. Parser generators are also harder to learn, and
  are another dependency and build step. So you can happily skip.
</p>
<p>
  If you still want to learn how to use a parser generator, look
  at books that are otherwise not ones I recommend like Modern
  Compiler Implementation in Java/C/ML or at The Dragon Book.
</p>
<p>
  You can pick up the basics of handwritten parsers from the items
  in the Introductory section above. The major complex part
  remaining is operator precedence. Even though I've implemented
  it a few times, I need to go and look up an explanation again
  every time.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, look up <strong>Shunting Yard</strong>, <strong>Pratt
    Parsing</strong>, or <strong>Precedence Climbing</strong>. There
  were one or two pages that helped me out in particular but I
  can't find them at the moment.
</p>

  a <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/03/31.html">survey
    of various explanations</a> that you may find useful.

<h3>Conspicuous books not on the list</h3>
<p>
  As you dig further into compilers/interpreters maybe you want to
  check these out. I own them and try to browse them occasionally
  but overall I'm not a fan. If you like them, great!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</li>
  <li>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (aka "The Dragon Book")</li>
  <li>
    The Little Typer
    <p>
      <small>
	Notes: I know some people like it but boy do I abhor both
	the style and content of this book. It is extremely
	complicated and the whimsical style just makes me
	angry. Maybe The Little Schemer is better since the topic
	is less complex. I'm scared to try it.
      </small>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/ML/C
    <p>
      <small>
	Notes: This one was the text for the compilers course I
	took in college and I loved that course. But ultimately
	I'm not sure this book is as good as some other resources
	listed above (in aggregate).
