title = NYC Systems at Night

---

<p>
  This is a pay-your-own-way happy hour for folks in databases,
  compilers, security, infrastructure, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  We meet at a bar in the last week of the month. We can fit about 30
  people, so I'll send out a request for invites once a month and the
  first 30 to respond get in!
</p>

  Join 100 other systems nerds in NYC: put your name and email down
