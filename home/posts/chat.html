title = Let's chat!

---

<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. And I go out of my way to make
  spend 30 minutes with any person who donates at least $100 to one of
  the following non-profits and sends me a receipt. The donation
  can be dedicated to "Chat for Education".
</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Malala Fund](https://malala.org/donate) ([100% Charity Score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/811397590))</li>
  <li>[ProLiteracy](https://www.proliteracy.org/donate/) ([100% Charity Score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/166076384))</li>
  <li>[UNICEF](https://www.unicefusa.org/how-help/ways-give?form=FUNSHMMBCHY) ([94% Charity Score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/131760110))</li>
  <li>[Girls Who Code](https://give.girlswhocode.com/give/77372/#!/donation/checkout) ([100% Charity Score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/166076384))</li>
  <li>[Scholarship America](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/042296967) ([99% Charity Score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/042296967))</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I've raised a humble <b>$5,625</b> for these groups since starting this
  program in November 2024. But you set something like this up and
  keep doing it over time and who knows where it'll be in a decade!
</p>

<p>
  If you cannot donate the $100 minimum to one of these non-profits, I
  would still be happy to hear from you! Just no guarantees on timing
  or availability.
