title = Let's chat!

---
  
<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. In the last year, between meetups
  and online communites, I've probably chatted individually with
  in-the-healthy-hundreds of new people. Undergraduate students, VCs,
  founders, VPs of Engineering, PhD students, and everyone in between.
</p>

<p class="bold">
  I am particularly interested right now in meeting people who use or
  operate data systems, or manage organizations doing so. I want to
  hear about what is challenging and where you're heading in the next
  few years.
</p>

<p>
  If meeting in person in NYC, I'm most available for lunch or
  afternoon coffee. If chatting online, I'm most available in NYC
  afternoons.
