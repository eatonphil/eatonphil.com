title = Let's chat!

---
  
<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. Through in-person meetups I
  started running since last December alone, I've probably met a few
  hundred new people. And if talking about chatting with folks online,
  it's probably been another few hundred in the last few years.

  If meeting in person in NYC, I'm most available for lunch or
  afternoon coffee. If chatting online, I'm most available in NYC
  afternoons.
