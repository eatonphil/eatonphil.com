title = Let's chat!

---
  
<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. Since I started running in-person
  meetups in December 2023, I've met probably a few hundred new
  people. And if talking about chatting with folks online in the last
  few years, it's been probably double the few hundred.

<p>
  If meeting in person in NYC, I'm most available for lunch or
  afternoon coffee. If chatting online, I'm most available in NYC
  afternoons.
