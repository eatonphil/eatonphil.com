title = Let's chat!

---
  
<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. In the last year, between meetups
  and online communites, I've probably chatted individually with
  in-the-healthy-hundreds of new people. Undergraduate students, VCs,
  founders, VPs of Engineering, PhD students, and everyone in between.
</p>

<p class="bold">
  I am particularly interested right now in meeting people who use or
  operate data systems, or manage organizations doing so. I want to
  hear about what is challenging and where you're heading in the next
  few years.
</p>

<p>
  Please [send me an email](mailto:me@eatonphil.com) with the
  following to help me out:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your LinkedIn</li>
  <li>What are we talking about?</li>
  <li>In-person or remote?</li>
  <li>If in-person, when will you be in NYC?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  No guarantees that timing or anything will work out but I would
  still be glad to hear from you!

<h3>Students and early-career devs</h3>

<p>
  I get a somewhat overwhelming number of requests from students and
  early-career developers asking about career paths and advice. I can
  only handle these so often, so I will refer you to the #career
  channel on the [Software Internals Discord](/discord.html) and also
  to the [Getting started with database
  development](https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/unj8d1/getting_started_with_database_development/)
  page.
