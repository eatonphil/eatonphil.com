title = Let's chat!

---
  
<p>
  I absolutely love meeting people. In the last year, between meetups
  and online communites, I've probably chatted individually with
  in-the-healthy-hundreds of new people. Undergraduate students, VCs,
  founders, VPs of Engineering, PhD students, and everyone in between.
</p>

<p>
  I typically chat with people about:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical marketing</li>
  <li>Technical writing</li>
  <li>Community organization</li>
  <li>Career development</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Please [send me an email](mailto:me@eatonphil.com) with the
  following to help me out:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your LinkedIn</li>
  <li>What are we talking about?</li>
  <li>In-person or remote?</li>
  <li>If in-person, when will you be in NYC?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Donate to guarantee availability</h3>

  I will make time for a 30-minute call for any person who donates at
  least $100 to one of the following charities and sends me a

<p>
  If you cannot donate the $100 minimum to one of these charities, I
  would still be happy to hear from you! Just no guarantees on timing
  or availability.

<h3>Why education charities?</h3>

<p>
  For most of my early life I did not understand the importance of an
  education. I could not fathom going to college, nor paying for
  it. After I eventually learned late in secondary school, and later
  got a full needs-based college scholarship, my family's situation
  changed and I had to drop out of college anyway. I had no support
  system to figure things out so I left and have been working in tech
  ever since. Things worked out for me, but it's a situation I almost
  never stop thinking about.
</p>

<p>
  Investing in education seems like one of the most effective ways to
  make a difference.
