<p>
  We are excited to announce the second night of talks in the [NYC
  Systems](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems.html) series! Talks are
  agnostic of language, framework, operating system, etc. And they are
  focused on engineering challenges, not product pitches.
</p>

<p>
  We are pleased to have Neil Ramaswamy and Jimmy Zelinskie speak, and
  glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
</p>

  If you plan to attend, please RSVP below!

<p>
  [Neil Ramaswamy](https://twitter.com/entersudonym) is a software
  engineer at Databricks, where he works on Apache Spark Structured
  Streaming. He recently graduated from Brown University, where he
  rewrote the distributed systems course, contributed to Brownâ€™s
  teaching operating system, and researched secure persistent memory
  with Maurice Herlihy.
</p>

<p>
  In this talk, Neil will explain the main complexities of the
  real-time SQL engines that power features like live-traffic maps
  (e.g. Google Maps), recommendation systems (e.g. TikTok), and much
  more. He'll discuss how these engines handle streaming aggregations,
  and then confront the magnificent subtleties of correct (and
  efficient!) streaming outer joins.

<p>
  Jimmy Zelinskie is a software engineer and product leader with the
  goal of empowering the world through the democratization of software
  through open source development. He's currently the CPO and
  cofounder of [authzed](https://authzed.com) where he's focused on
  bringing hyperscaler authorization best-practices to the industry at
  large.
</p>

<p>
  At
  [CoreOS](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/what-was-coreos),
  he helped pioneer the cloud-native ecosystem by starting and
  contributing to many of its foundational open source projects. After
  being acquired by [Red Hat](https://redhat.com), his focus shifted
  to the enablement and adoption of cloud-native technologies by
  enterprises. To this day, he continues contributing to the
  cloud-native ecosystem by building the future on top of these
  technologies and maintaining standards such as [Open Container
  Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) (OCI).
