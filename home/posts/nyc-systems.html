### What makes a good talk?

<p>
  Talks should start broad but go deep, taking smart developers on an
  interesting journey into the challenges of some particular topic
  they may not have a background in. Interesting talks don't baby developers.
</p>

<p>
  Talks should not be product pitches. It's ok to mention your company
  but the talks should highlight and show off your engineering
  organization, practices, and challenges; not your product.
