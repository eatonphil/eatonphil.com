### For potential speakers

<p>
  Thank your for your interest! It would be excellent to work
  together. Please read on so we are on the same page about what we
  are looking for.
</p>

<p>
  Talks should start broad but go deep, taking a smart audience on an
  interesting journey into the challenges of some particular topic
  they may not have a background in. Talks should not stay high-level
  only for the sake of babying the audience.
</p>

<p>
  Talks should not be product pitches. It is ok for speakers to
  mention their company but the talks should highlight and show off
  their engineering organization, practices, and challenges; not their
  product.
</p>

<p>
  Speakers can expect an audience of talented developers across a wide
  variety of systems fields. These talks are a good opportunity to get
  engineers excited about the challenges the speaker's organization
  face. That is, speakers are always welcome to mention if they are
  hiring.
