title = Sundays Reading in the Park, NYC

---

<p>
  One of my favorite things to do on a Sunday is to visit my favorite
  parks and read a book. And while I normally do this alone, I'd kind
  of rather do it with other people!
</p>

<p>
  Fill out [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/XnHZDdkfM56MmZKy8) if
  you'd like to get invites!
</p>

<h3>Who is this for?</h3>

<p>
  If you love to read and you love parks, this is for you!
</p>

<h3>How will it work?</h3>

<p>
  You bring a book, bring a coffee/tea/mat√©.The quiet reading session
  will run from 11AM-11:45AM. After that it's unstructured social
  time.
</p>

<p>
  I will send out a request for invites each week it runs. Like other
  events I run, the first 20 people to respond get a calendar invite!
  Please don't show up without a calendar invite!
</p>

<h3>How often?</h3>

<p>
  I go almost every weekend to a park to read. And the weather isn't
  perfect year round. So it would be great to run this every other
  weekend, but that will depend on interest/turnout.
</p>

<h3>What prompted this?</h3>

<p>
  Most of my network is software developers and I'd like to escape the
  bubble. I keep running events like the [NYC Systems Coffee
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html) and [NYC
  Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz), so I've been wanting to try
  something completely unrelated to career networking.
