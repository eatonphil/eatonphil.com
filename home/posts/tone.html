This is a friendly and encouraging community. We are here to learn and
improve. There are folks here who are experts in the field with
decades of experience in industry and academia. And there are folks
who are just getting started. They are all welcome.

We're interested in learning how things work under the hood and we're
not satisfied with groupthink or even Chesterton's fence. These may
not be the right goals to have at work, but this isn't a workplace
it's a community.

Bullshitting and putting other people down are not welcome here.

Whether on Discord or in a book club or on social media, I try to
follow these guidelines and expect others who choose to be involved
with stuff I organize to follow these guidelines too.
