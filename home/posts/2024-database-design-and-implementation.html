  Part of the [Software Internals Email Bookclub](/bookclub.html).
</p>

<p>
  The next book we'll cover is [Database Design and Implementation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7)
  by Edward Sciore.
</p>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. You probably need a Google
  account. Your email will be public if you post but otherwise it will
  not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There will be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each week, one person will send out an email on Saturday recapping
  the chapter to start discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph
  or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in
  afterward.
</p>

<p>
  Don't worry about being an expert and don't worry about what to say,
  I'll go first and will prod you when it's your turn.

### Discussion Schedule

<p>
  Each week one member of the group kicks off discussion for the
  previous chapter. I.e. on October 5th I'll start a discussion on
  Chapter 1. So you should read the chapter before the date it is
  listed.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the folks (tentatively) starting discussion each week.
