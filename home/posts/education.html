title = Chat for Education

---

<p>
  Hi! I'm Phil (he/him). I've been a developer, engineering manager,
  and a cofounder. I run a popular
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eatonphil) account. I run the
  [Software Internals Discord](https://eatonphil.com/discord.html),
  the [Software Internals Book
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html), the [NYC Systems Coffee
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html), and I
  co-organize [NYC Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz/).
</p>

<p>
  I chat with hundreds of people (students, developers, managers,
  founders, folks in VC, etc.) each year over coffee just because I enjoy
  meeting people.
</p>

<p>
  But during the month of November I'd like to put that time to use on
  something even more broadly impactful.
</p>

<p>
  During the month of November I will
  be accepting invitations for a 30-minute chat when you make a donation of at
  least $200 to [Scholarship
  America](https://scholarshipamerica.org). Scholarship America is a
  [four-star charity with a 99%
  score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/042296967) according to
  Charity Navigator.
</p>

<h3>How to qualify</h3>

<p>
  Make a donation of at least $200 to Scholarship America
  [here](https://scholarshipamerica.org/donate/) and [email
  me](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) the receipt.
</p>
<p>
  In the Dedication section feel free to use "Chat for Education" as
  the First Name and leave the Last Name field blank.
</p>
<p>
  When you email me, please include your availability, your LinkedIn,
  your Twitter handle (if you will allow me to publicly thank you),
  and what you'd like to talk about!
</p>

<p>
  I will make myself available between the hours of 7AM and 8PM NY
  time.
</p>

<h3>Suggested topics</h3>

<p>
  I am an expert on technical writing, technical marketing, and
  building technical communities. In my actual day job I am a
  programmer building databases and distributed systems. But I am not
  an *expert* on those topics.
</p>
<p>
  Any of these would probably make a good topic! But do not feel
  limited by these either.
</p>

<h3>Matching donations</h3>

<p>
  If you or your company is interested in matching donations, please
  [email me](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) your information including
  your name and logo and the amount up to which you will match. At the
  end of the month I will submit all the receipts I have received to
  you as proof.
</p>

<p>
  Your name and logo will be displayed on this page and I will be free
  to mention your participation on social media.
