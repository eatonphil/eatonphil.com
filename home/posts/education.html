title = Chat for Education Fundraiser

---

<p>
  Hi! I'm Phil (he/him). I've been a developer, engineering manager,
  and a cofounder. I run a popular
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eatonphil) account. I run the
  [Software Internals Discord](https://eatonphil.com/discord.html),
  the [Software Internals Book
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html), the [NYC Systems Coffee
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html), and I
  co-organize [NYC Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz/).
</p>

<p>
  I chat with hundreds of people (students, developers, managers,
  founders, folks in VC, etc.) each year over coffee just because I enjoy
  meeting people.
</p>

<p>
  But during the month of November I'd like to put that time to use on
  something even more broadly impactful.
</p>

<p>
  During the month of November I will
  be accepting invitations for a 30-minute chat when you make a donation of at
  least $200 to [Scholarship
  America](https://scholarshipamerica.org). Scholarship America is a
  [four-star charity with a 99%
  score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/042296967) according to
  Charity Navigator.
</p>

<h3>How to qualify</h3>

<p>
  Make a donation of at least $200 to Scholarship America
  [here](https://scholarshipamerica.org/donate/) and [email
  me](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) the receipt.
</p>
<p>
  In the Dedication section feel free to use "Chat for Education" as
  the First Name and leave the Last Name field blank.
</p>
<p>
  When you email me, please include your availability, your LinkedIn,
  your Twitter handle (if you will allow me to publicly thank you),
  and what you'd like to talk about!
</p>

<p>
  I will make myself available between the hours of 7AM and 8PM NY
  time.
</p>

<h3>Suggested topics</h3>

<p>
  Preface: I am very careful about saying what (I think) I am good
  at. Moreover I hope you see this fundementally as an excuse to
  donate to an education charity more than anything else. But in any
  case, it seemed appropriate to be up front about what I'm giving you
  in return!
</p>

<p>
  I am an expert on technical writing, technical marketing, and
  building technical communities. In my actual day job I am a
  programmer building databases and distributed systems. But I am not
  an *expert* on those topics.
</p>

<p>
  Any of these would probably make a good topic! But do not feel
  limited by these either.
</p>

<p>
  If none of these topics nor any other aspect of my background
  resonates with you, this effort probably isn't a good fit for you
  and that's ok!
</p>

<h3>Matching donations</h3>

<p>
  If you or your company is interested in matching donations, please
  [email me](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) your information including
  your name and logo and the amount up to which you will match. At the
  end of the month I will submit all the receipts I have received to
  you as proof.
</p>

<p>
  Your name and logo will be displayed on this page and I will be free
  to mention your participation on social media.
