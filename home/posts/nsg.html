title = Northeast Systems Group on Discord

---

<p>
  I host a <a href="https://discord.gg/gG7HVcX5Y6">Discord</a> (120+
  members) for folks in systems software in the Northeast US. So for
  folks at (or interested in working at) companies building stuff like
  compilers, databases, DNS, Linux hosting, devtools, etc. And focused
  geographically around DC, Philly, NYC, and Boston.
</p>

<p>
  The big benefit of a group like this is to meet other folks in
  similar fields in the area and to <em>find cool local jobs</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Come hang out!
