title = Leadership in Tech Book Club

---

<p>
  This book club is for leaders at tech companies. High level ICs
  (staff+) and managers, particularly in engineering and product
  management.
</p>

<p>
  Not only is it a chance to read books you likely already wanted to,
  but to do it with a little bit of accountability and to benefit from
  the discussion, whether you actively participate or merely lurk.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. There will be no Zoom or
  Google Hangout, it will purely be over text email.
</p>

<p>
  Each weekend, one person will send out an email recapping the
  chapter or asking questions to start discussion. It can be as short
  as a paragraph or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can
  chime in afterward.
</p>

<p>
  I will solicit these chapter discussion leaders before we start each
  new book.
</p>
