title = #wehack Postgres Internals
date = October, 2023

---

<p>
  From October 29th - November 5th I'll host a Discord group of folks
  who want to dig into Postgres internals: write about it, try to break
  it, fix a bug in it, or improve the docs.
</p>

<p>
  Basically, a support group for people who want to figure this stuff
  out together.
</p>

### Learn or contribute

<p>
  If all we do is get more folks looking at Postgres code, building it,
  and trying out tweaks to it -- without any contributions merged -- I'd
  see it as a success. If the week produces any new contributions merged
  into Postgres, fantastic.
</p>

<p>
  Existing Postgres contributors are welcome to join.
</p>

### Be respectful

<p>
  In order to cut down on mod effort and the likelihood of this
  turning into the [worst of
  Hacktoberfest](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/), I'm going to
  limit invites to Discord to folks who have been programmers for a
  bit and can provide social proof such as a GitHub, LinkedIn, or
  technical website.
</p>

<p>
  It is imperative to be respectful of open-source maintainers. And
  folks caught doing otherwise will get booted from the Discord.
</p>

### Once and done

<p>
  After November 5th the Discord will be deleted. Any contributions made
  to Postgres (docs, bug fixes, etc.) will be noted on this page
  afterward, as will any non-trivial blog posts or GitHub projects
  showing something interesting about Postgres (created during the course
  of the event).
</p>

<p>
  I'll also add to this page resources folks share for Postgres
  internals and contributing to Postgres.
</p>

<p>
  [Sign up here](https://forms.gle/pFiChqXY8Hh11r39A) and I'll email you
  an invite to Discord.
</p>

### Ideas

<ul>
  <li>Read through docs of a new feature. Try out the new feature. Note missing or confusing parts.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to write Postgres extensions in your favorite language.</li>
  <li>Add a new Postgres storage backend via Table Access Methods.</li>
  <li>Write about Postgres's WAL format.</li>
  <li>Build a CDC implementation on top of Postgres's WAL.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to write a new builtin function or extend Postgres's syntax (not for the sake of getting this merged necessarily).</li>
</ul>
