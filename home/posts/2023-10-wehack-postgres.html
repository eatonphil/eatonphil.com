title = #wehack Postgres Internals
date = October, 2023

---

From October 29th - November 5th I'll host a Discord group of folks
who want to dig into Postgres internals: write about it, try to break
it, fix a bug in it, or improve the docs.

Basically, a support group for people who want to figure this stuff
out together.

### Learn or contribute

If all we do is get more folks looking at Postgres code, building it,
and trying out tweaks to it -- without any contributions merged -- I'd
see it as a success. If the week produces any new contributions merged
into Postgres, fantastic.

Existing Postgres contributors are welcome to join.

### Be respectful

In order to limit the event of this turning into the [worst of
Hacktoberfest](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/), I'm going to
limit invites to Discord to folks who have been programmers for a bit
and can provide social proof such as a GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter,
Mastodon account, or technical website.

It is imperative to be respectful of open-source maintainers. And
folks caught doing otherwise will get booted from the Discord.

### Once and done

After November 5th the Discord will be deleted. Any contributions made
to Postgres (docs, bug fixes, etc.) will be noted on this page
afterward, as will any non-trivial blog posts or GitHub projects
showing something interesting about Postgres (created during the course
of the event).

I'll also add to this page resources folks share for Postgres
internals and contributing to Postgres.

[Sign up here](https://forms.gle/pFiChqXY8Hh11r39A) and I'll email you
an invite to Discord.

### Ideas

<ul>
  <li>Read through docs of a new feature. Try out the new feature. Note missing or confusing parts.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to write Postgres extensions in your favorite language.</li>
  <li>Add a new Postgres storage backend via Table Access Methods.</li>
  <li>Write about Postgres's WAL format.</li>
  <li>Build a CDC implementation on top of Postgres's WAL.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to write a new builtin function or extend Postgres's syntax (not for the sake of getting this merged necessarily).</li>
</ul>
