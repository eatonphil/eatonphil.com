title = Software Internals Book Club

---

<p>
  I run a little email book club reading the highest-caliber books
  that we might otherwise be intimidated to read on our own; typically
  covering topics in databases, distributed systems, and software
  performance.
</p>

<p>
  There are over 1,600 members from around the world and between
  300-800 join for any given book. Members include undergrads, grad
  students, early-career programmers, experienced programmers,
  founders, and everyone in between. Everyone who is interested is
  welcome to join.
</p>

<p>
  I try to always find interesting and diverse discussion leaders that
  help make the discussions the most important part of the club, even
  beyond the books themselves.
</p>

<p>
  We're currently
  reading <a href="/2025-concurrency-control-and-recovery-in-database-systems.html">Concurrency
  Control and Recovery in Database Systems</a>.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. There will be no Zoom or
  Google Hangout, it will purely be over text email.
</p>

<p>
  Each weekend, one person will send out an email recapping the
  chapter or asking questions to start discussion. It can be as short
  as a paragraph or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can
  chime in afterward.
</p>

<p>
  I will solicit these chapter discussion leaders before we start each
  new book.
</p>

<h3>Loose criteria</h3>

<p>
  The focus is on books that would be interesting and useful to
  senior+ developers (whatever that means to you), though anyone is
  welcome.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between 350-550 pages</li>
  <li>Focused on a specific software topic, not on philosophy of software in general</li>
  <li>Generally not textbooks</li>
  <li>Completable in around 3 months reading 1-2 chapters per week</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Have a book that fits the above criteria? [Let me
  know](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com)!
</p>

<h3>Promising but probably not good fits</h3>

<p>
  Primarily because they are too large and I worry about asking people
  to commit for too long a time period.
