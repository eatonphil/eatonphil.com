<p>
  Hey! I'm Phil (he/him). In the past I've been a developer, a
  manager, and a cofounder. At companies as large as Oracle and as
  small as TigerBeetle. Today I'm a staff engineer working on Postgres
  products at
  [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/importance-of-giving-back-to-postgresql).
</p>

<p>
  I am a college dropout (not by choice; stay in school!) and for the
  last 10 years I've chased my way down the software stack starting from
  humble beginnings with the venerable jQuery and PHP.
</p>

<p>
 I try to practice [healthy obsession](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-08-24-obsession.html).
</p>

<p>
  To that end, I run the [NYC Systems Coffee
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html) (400+
  members), co-run the [NYC Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz) talk
  series (1.2k+ members), run an online [Software Internals Book
  Club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html) (1.5k+ members), run
  [/r/databasedevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/)
  (8.5k+ members), and I run a [Software Internals
  Discord](https://eatonphil.com/discord.html) (7.3k+ members) that
  has, among other things, become a home for database and distributed
  systems developers.
</p>

<p>
  I play a good deal of
  [volleyball](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-12-26-volleyball-in-nyc.html)
  in NYC, keep trying to [cook new
  dishes](https://www.instagram.com/eatonphilz), and love to
  [read](https://www.goodreads.com/eatonphil).
</p>

<p>
  My [writing](https://notes.eatonphil.com), which in 2024
  [passed](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-11-28-1-million-views.html)
  1 million total views, has been cited in the book [Writing for
  Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/writing-for-developers).
</p>

  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eatonphil/) (8.4k+
  followers), [Twitter](https://x.com/eatonphil) (23k+ followers),

<h3>Chatting and fundraising</h3>

<p>
  I absolutely love to meet people. If you ever want to catch up,
  [here's a little page](/chat.html) to help me out with scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  I go out of my way to chat with folks who donate $100 to educational
  non-profits (details on that page) and I've raised a
  humble <b>$1350</b> since starting this program in November 2024.
</p>

<h4>Banh Mi on me</h4>

<p>
  If you're working on a PhD, you're a postdoc, or you're pre-tenure
  faculty, visiting NYC, I'll buy you lunch (has to be Banh Mi) if we
  can talk about your work and interests! It doesn't have to be
  related to computer science. [Email](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) me
  when you'll be around.
