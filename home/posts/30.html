title = Turning 30 fundraiser

---

<p>
  I turn 30 on May 7, 2025. It's a bit of a scary event! I want to make
  the most of the occasion so in lieu of other plans, I'm taking the
  opportunity to raise funds for educational non-profits.
</p>

<p>
  I was forced to drop out of college when I was 19 because I could no
  longer afford to go. It was incredibly depressing and scarring. With
  luck and obsession over the years I was able to get past this
  handicap. I am fortunate at this point to be able to enjoy my work and
  life quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
  But I don't want others to have to go through that scarring
  process. At the very least, I want to play some small part in
  improving access to education. So! If you've ever enjoyed my writing
  or you've enjoyed one of my communities, I'll ask you for this
  little birthday present! And you will get something in return.
</p>

<p>
  If you donate any amount over $10 and [send me a
  receipt](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) (screenshot is fine), I will
  list your name and a link of your choice (SFW, etc.) on this page.
</p>

<p>
  If you donate any amount over $30 and [send me a
  receipt](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) (screenshot is fine), I will
  take a 30-minute call with you on any topic you'd like. Or I'll meet
  you in person in NYC when you're around.
</p>

<p>
  Any of these non-profits are game:
