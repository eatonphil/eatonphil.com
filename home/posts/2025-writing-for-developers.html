---

<p>
  Part of the [Software Internals Email Bookclub](/bookclub.html).
</p>

<p>
  Taking a temporary break from purely software reads, the next book
  we'll cover is [Writing for
  Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/writing-for-developers) by
  Piotr Sarna and Cynthia Dunlop. You can use the discount code
  <b>SIBCdunlop</b> for 50% off.
</p>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. You probably need a Google
  account. Your email will be public if you post but otherwise it will
  not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There will be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each week, one person will send out an email on Saturday recapping
  the chapter to start discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph
  or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in
  afterward.
</p>

<p>
  Don't worry about being an expert and don't worry about what to say,
  I'll go first and will prod you when it's your turn.

### Discussion Schedule

<p>
  It's a short book and non-technical so we will read two chapters per
  week, roughly 30 pages per week.
</p>
<p>
  Each week one member of the group kicks off discussion for the
  previous two chapter. On February 8th I'll start a discussion on
  chapters 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>
  You should read the chapters before the date it
  is listed.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the folks (tentatively) starting discussion each week.
