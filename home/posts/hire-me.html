<p>
  Hey there! I'm a developer with 10 years of experience. During those
  10 years as a developer, I've sometimes led and managed teams (at a
  startup and at Oracle), tried to [start my own
  company](https://github.com/multiprocessio), and served as a
  [cofounder at a database company](https://github.com/tigerbeetle).
</p>

<p>
  I'm most comfortable with backend systems development in Go. Though
  over the years I've professionally worked with PHP, Node.js, Python,
  and Zig. And I'm pretty familiar with the browser and operations
  work as well.
</p>

<p>
  My focus in the last 4 years has been data systems. I'm most
  interested in working on developer infrastructure in general and/or
  data systems specifically; and for the moment, as an individual
  contributor.
