title = Hire me

<p>
  Hey there! I'm Phil Eaton (he/him). In the last 10 years, I've been
  a developer, managed developer teams (at a startup and at Oracle),
  tried to [start my own company](https://github.com/multiprocessio),
  and, most recently, served as a [cofounder at a database
  company](https://github.com/tigerbeetle) where I ran marketing (what
  some people call devrel).
</p>

<p>
  However, as I hope you notice from my blog, my passion is software
  internals. In my next role I'd like to focus again on software
  development, particularly on a database or distributed system
  product. I have no language preference, but I am most comfortable
  with Go.

<p>
  Here are a few recent posts of mine on topics that get me excited:
