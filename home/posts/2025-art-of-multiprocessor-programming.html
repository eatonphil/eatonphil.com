<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. You probably need a Google
  account. Your email will be public if you post but otherwise it will
  not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There will be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<p>
  You should read the chapter before the date it
  is listed.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each weekend, one person will send out an email to start
  discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph or two just to get
  discussion going. Anyone else can chime in afterward.
</p>

<p>
  It's most fun if this discussion starter doesn't summarize the
  chapter but tells a bit about themselves, their background, and what
  resonated or was confusing in the chapter, or how it tied back to
  something they experienced in the real-world.
