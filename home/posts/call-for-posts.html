<p>
  I would like to broaden my awareness of good work folks are doing.
  Particularly folks who might otherwise lack visibility. If you
  publish blog posts on any of the following topics, please feel free
  to [email me](mailto:phil@eatonphil.com) your post.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reliably reading and writing to disk</li>
  <li>Efficiently reading and writing to disk</li>
  <li>Deterministic emulation of Linux processes</li>
  <li>Comparison of object representations across programming languages</li>
  <li>Comparison of calling conventions (particularly in VMs) across programming languages</li>
  <li>Implementing distributed consensus protocols other than Raft (EPaxos, Viewstamped Replication, etc.) ([Entries](/cfp-non-raft.html)</li>
  <li>Implementing disk-backed B-Trees or LSM trees</li>
  <li>Implementing various transaction isolation layers (on a toy or in-memory database)</li>
  <li>SIMD basics: find first X character, count X character, count XX substring, find all occurrences of X character, JSON parsing</li>
  <li>Implementing TCP/IP without libraries</li>
  <li>Implementing HTTP/2 without libraries</li>
  <li>Where does a handwritten lexer outperform a regex?</li>
  <li>Reading SQLite or Postgres data files without libraries (including libsqlite and libpq)</li>

  <li>Implementing a useful subset of regex</li>
  <li>Building a minimal Linux-compatible operating system (i.e. simple gcc-compiled C programs can run in this environment)</li>
  <li>All the places bytecode VMs show up in common Linux utilities (BC, DC, jq, etc.)</li>
  <li>Demonstrate propagation of disk corruption in any popular Raft library (etcd, hashicorp, etc.)</li>
  <li>Demonstrate errors with (disk) fault injection in any popular database</li>
  <li>Demonstrate fault domains for or error propagation in common RAID configurations</li>
</ul>
