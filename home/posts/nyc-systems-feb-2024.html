<p>
  We are excited to announce the first night of talks in the [NYC
  Systems](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems.html) series! Talks are
  agnostic of language, framework, operating system, etc. And they are
  focused on engineering challenges, not product pitches.
</p>

<p>
  We are pleased to have Paul Butler and Stefan Karpinski speak, and
  glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
</p>

# Talks

### You Might Not Need a CRDT: Document Sync in the Wild

<img class="profile" src="https://paulbutler.org/images/paul.jpg" />

<p>
  [Paul](https://paulbutler.org) is a co-founder of [Jamsocket](https://jamsocket.com), which provides infrastructure for scaling WebSocket services. He also writes the [Browsertech Digest](https://digest.browsertech.com). Prior to that, he was a quant at Two Sigma and an engineer at Google.
</p>

<p>
  Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a family of data structure commonly associated with the real-time state synchronization functionality of applications like Google Docs and Figma, neither of which actually use CRDTs!
</p>

<p>
  Paul will explain the basics of CRDTs, when they are useful, and what people use instead when they arenâ€™t.
