<p>
  We are excited to announce the first night of talks in the NYC
  Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
  system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
  product pitches.
</p>

<p>
  We are pleased to have Paul Butler and Stefan Karpinski speak, and
  glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.

# Talks

### You Might Not Need a CRDT: Document Sync in the Wild

<p>
  [Paul](https://paulbutler.org) is a co-founder of [Jamsocket](https://jamsocket.com), which provides infrastructure for scaling WebSocket services. He also writes the [Browsertech Digest](https://digest.browsertech.com). Prior to that, he was a quant at Two Sigma and an engineer at Google.
</p>

<p>
  Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a family of data structure commonly associated with the real-time state synchronization functionality of applications like Google Docs and Figma, neither of which actually use CRDTs!
</p>

<p>
  Paul will explain the basics of CRDTs, when they are useful, and what people use instead when they arenâ€™t.
