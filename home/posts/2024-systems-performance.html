<p>
  Now that the email book club around [Database
  Internals](https://eatonphil.com/2023-database-internals.html) is
  coming to a close, it's time for a new one!
</p>

<p>
  We're going to cover [Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud,
  2nd
  Edition](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2020-07-15/systems-performance-2nd-edition.html)
  by Brendan Gregg.
</p>

<p>
  Yes, the 2nd Edition. The 1st Edition has fewer chapters, has more
  focus on Solaris, had fewer technical reviewers, etc. Brendan
  describes the differences in the link above.
</p>

<p>
  We'll read one chapter a week and discuss over a Google Group. You do
  not need a Google account to join the Google Group. Your email will be
  public if you post but otherwise it will not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There'll be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each week, one person will send out an email on Saturday recapping
  the chapter to start discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph
  or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in
  afterward. If no one volunteers to lead a chapter, I'll get the
  discussion going each time.
</p>

<p>
  Don't worry about being an expert and don't worry about what to say,
  I'll go first and will prod you when it's your turn.
</p>

<h3>Sign up (closed)</h3>

<p>
  Over 500 people signed up. Signups are now closed! If you didn't
  make it this time, there'll likely be a future one when this one
  ends.
</p>

### Discussion Schedule

<p>
  Each week one member of the group kicks off discussion for the
  previous chapter. I.e. on Feb 10th I'll start a discussion on
  Chapter 1. So you should read the chapter before the date it is
  listed.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the folks starting discussion each week.
