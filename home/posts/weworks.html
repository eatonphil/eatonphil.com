<p>
  At the moment, WeWork doesn't give you a catalog of locations and
  amenities. Which ones have espresso machines? All access rooms?
  Who knows!
</p>

<p>
  So I decided to visit every WeWork in Manhattan south of Central Park. All 28 of them.
</p>

<p>
   (Not actually that many. Many that show up on Google
   Maps are not actually around anymore.)
</p>

<p>
  Currently, 5 down and 23 more to go.
