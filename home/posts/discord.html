title = A little Discord

---

<p>
  I host a <a href="https://discord.gg/PmmShtF7WS">hacker
    Discord</a> (1.5k+ members) designed to expose devs (and myself)
  to the internals of databases, compilers, operating systems,
  browsers, emulators, etc. And to provide a community around this
  kind of exploration.
</p>

<p>
  More recently this has also expanded to include discussion around
  experienced developers, engineering management, and
  architecture/ops/production systems.
