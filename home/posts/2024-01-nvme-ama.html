title = Reddit AMA with Samsung NVMe experts

---

<p>
  I am very excited that [Klaus
  Jensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klausbirkelund/) from Samsung,
  along with a few of his colleagues, have agreed to join
  [/r/databasedevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/)
  for an hour-long AMA on all things NVMe. To be held at the end of
  January.
</p>

<p>
  This is a unique chance to ask a group of NVMe experts all your
  disk/NVMe questions.
</p>

<p>
  To pique your interest, take another look at these two papers:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>[What Modern NVMe Storage Can Do, And How To Exploit It: High-Performance I/O for High-Performance Storage Engines](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2090-haas.pdf)</li>
  <li>[I/O Interface Independence with xNVMe](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534056.3534936)</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Authors of 2., Klaus and Simon, will be present for the AMA.
