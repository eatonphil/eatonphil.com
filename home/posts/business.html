title = My favorite business books

---

<p>
  It's incredibly interesting to read the history of an industry or
  stories of an individual and it often gives me ideas. While some of
  the books on this page are commonly recommended, most of them I
  think are not so easy to stumble on.
</p>

<p>
   That said, most of them also have audiobook versions since that is
   my preferred way to read long books.
</p>

<p>
  For the most part I've omitted books that I've rated lower than a
  3/5 review. The page is limited to books I've read since 2016 when I
  started keeping track.

### Footnotes

<p>
  † The only reason this is rated so poorly is because the book is
  written backwards. Realistically it's probably a 3 or 4 out of 5 but
  the structure made me angry.
