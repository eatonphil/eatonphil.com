title = Database Internals Book Club
date = 2023

---

<p>
  Part of the [Software Internals Email Book Club](/bookclub.html).
</p>

<p>
  With my in-person book club in NYC (reading [Designing Data
  Intensive
  Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/))
  coming to a close and the days getting colder, I want to try a
  virtual book club for Winter 2023.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to cover [Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/)
  by Alex Petrov.
</p>

<p>
  We'll read one chapter a week and discuss over a Google Group. You do
  not need a Google account to join the Google Group. Your email will be
  public if you post but otherwise it will not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There'll be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
  Now that the book club is over, here are some notes and projects
  members created during the course of the club.

</ul>

<h3>Leaders</h3>

<p>
  Basically, someone will lead discussion each week sending out an email
  on Saturday recapping the chapter. It can be as short as a paragraph
  or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in
  afterward. If no one volunteers to lead a chapter, I'll get the
  discussion going each time.
</p>

<p>
  Don't worry about being an expert and don't worry about what to say,
  I'll go first and will prod you when it's your turn.
