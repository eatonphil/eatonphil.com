<p>
  Part of the [Software Internals Email Book Club](/bookclub.html).
</p>

<p>
  The next book we'll read is Concurrency Control and Recovery in
  Database Systems by Phil Bernstein (ISBN 0201107155). Phil makes the PDF of the book
  freely [available on his Microsoft
  page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/philbe/book/).
</p>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. You probably need a Google
  account. Your email will be public if you post but otherwise it will
  not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There will be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each week, one person will send out an email on Saturday recapping
  the chapter to start discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph
  or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in
  afterward.
</p>

<p>
  It's most fun if the discussion starter doesn't summarize the
  chapter but tells a bit about themselves, their background, and what
  resonated or was confusing in the chapter, or how it tied back to
  something they experienced in the real-world.

### Discussion Schedule

<p>
  We will read one chapter per week, roughly 40 pages per week.
</p>
<p>
  Each week one member of the group kicks off discussion for the
  previous chapter. On April 26th I'll start a discussion on
  chapter 1.
</p>
<p>
  You should read the chapter before the date it
  is listed.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the folks (tentatively) starting discussion each week.
