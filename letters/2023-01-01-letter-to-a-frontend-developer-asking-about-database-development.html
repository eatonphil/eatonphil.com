      Hey [Redacted]! It's nice to hear from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You write that you're a self-taught frontend developer who would
      like to be able to work on more complex systems like
      databases. You asked about my learning path (since my site
      mentions I started with jQuery and PHP).
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, ambition/desire is a powerful thing! I was a manager
      for a while and I'd watch folks across all apparent experience
      and talent levels. When they said they wanted to do something
      I'd see it gnaw at them until they did it.
    </p>
    <p>If there's something
      you think you would want to do, you likely can do it. Or
      something close.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least in this specific case, if you are a self-taught
      frontend developer who wants to end up hacking on databases,
      that's 100% doable over the course of time if you stick with it.
    </p>
    <h4>Database development</h4>
    <p>
      If your question was: "As an experienced developer, how do I get
      into or learn more about database development?", I'd just link
      you to
      the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/unj8d1/getting_started_with_database_development/">Getting
      started with database development</a> page on
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment">/r/databasedevelopment</a>
      that I put together with much help from Twitter friends.
    </p>

    <h4>Beyond frontend</h4>
    <p>
      But I'm interpreting your question as a little bit more than
      what that page has to offer. Many of the topics on that page
      might be a jump from what a frontend developer commonly
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      So other aspects of moving closer to something like hacking on
      databases might include moving over to backend programming
      positions over time.
    </p>

    <h4>Ease of transfer</h4>
    <p>
      It's often easiest to transfer roles within the same company, as
      opposed to getting an entirely different job at a new
      company. There are some exceptions to that. It can sometimes be
      easier to join a small(er) company with the exact role you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in general once you're inside a company you can tell your
      manager what you'd like to do in the future and you and your
      manager cand find ways throughout your workday to get you closer
      to the goal. Maybe you'll take on small projects with another
      team. Or dedicated 2/5s of your time with another team. And so
      on.
    </p>

    <h4>Non-core development roles at database companies</h4>
    <p>
      One more approach to consider (especially considering the above
      points) is that database companies are also often SaaS
      companies. Or at least they need to build web management portals
      (hosted somewhere).
    </p>
    <p>
      That means that database companies employ all the same types as
      other software companies: designers, frontend developers, system
      administrators/devops, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working at a company that builds a software you'd like to hack
      on is great exposure, even if you aren't yet qualified for the
      exact work you want to do. Thankfully, over time you will likely
      have opportunities to transfer closer to the work you'd like to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, even my focus at TigerBeetle is not hacking on the
      core code of TigerBeetle. But I get to write about it and
      document it and build clients and talk with customers and work
      with our devs to explain it. It's an incredible learning
      experience.
    </p>

    <h4>Spirit of building</h4>
    <p>
      The last thing I want to mention is that (in my experience,
      anyway) it helps to develop a spirit of building things you
      don't understand. Write your React clone, write your own HTTP
      server, write your own lisp interpreter, write your own
      compiler, write your own database.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I started doing this because I just didn't like black
      boxes. I didn't like when people spoke with hesitation on
      subjects when answers *could* be discovered. I wanted to know
      how stuff worked. I've been doing that for ~10 years now so it
      sort of gets easier over time, but the subject always
      changes. And I get to tackle harder problems each time.
    </p>

    <h4>Good luck!</h4>
    <p>
      My path personally was a combination of moving over time to jobs
      closer to systems programming. In no particular order. From full
      stack, to frontend, to full stack, to backend, to building my
      own company, to whatever it is you can say I'm doing now. :)
      Switching between management, tech lead, and IC positions
      throughout. All the while I challenged myself by reading books
      and building projects from scratch to teach myself.

      You can do it if you stick with it! Stay in touch. And come hang
      out on <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord with
      other hackers</a> if you want!
