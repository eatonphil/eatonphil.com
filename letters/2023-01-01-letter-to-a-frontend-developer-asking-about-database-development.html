      Hey [Redacted]! It's nice to hear from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You write that you're a self-taught frontend developer who would
      like to be able to work on more complex systems like
      databases. You asked about my learning path (since my site
      mentions I started with jQuery and PHP).
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, ambition/desire is a powerful thing! I was a manager
      for a while and I'd watch folks across all apparent experience
      and talent levels. When they said they wanted to do something
      I'd see it gnaw at them until they did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there's something you want to do, you likely can do it. Or
      something close.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least in this specific case, if you are a self-taught
      frontend developer who wants to end up hacking on databases,
      that's 100% doable over the course of time if you stick with it.
    </p>
    <h4>Database development</h4>
    <p>
      If your question was: "As an experienced developer, how do I get
      into or learn more about database development?", I'd just link
      you to
      the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/unj8d1/getting_started_with_database_development/">Getting
      started with database development</a> page on
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment">/r/databasedevelopment</a>
      that I put together with much help from Twitter friends.
    </p>

    <h4>Beyond frontend</h4>
    <p>
      But I'm interpreting your question as a little bit more than
      what that page has to offer. Many of the topics on that page
      might be a jump from what a frontend developer commonly
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      So other aspects of moving closer to something like hacking on
      databases might include switching to backend programming
      at work, or hacking on your own educational projects.
    </p>

    <h4>Ease of transfer</h4>
    <p>
      It's often easiest to transfer roles within the same company, as
      opposed to getting an entirely different job at a new
      company. There are some exceptions to that. It can sometimes be
      easier to join a small(er) company with the exact role you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in general once you're inside a company you can tell your
      manager what you'd like to do in the future. You and your
      manager can find ways during your workday to get you closer
      to the goal. Maybe you'll take on small projects with another
      team. Or dedicate 20% of your time to another team. And so
      on.
    </p>

    <h4>Non-core development roles at database companies</h4>
    <p>
      One more approach to consider is that database companies are
      often SaaS companies. Or at least they need to build web
      management portals (hosted somewhere).
    </p>
    <p>
      That means that database companies employ all the same positions as
      other software companies: designers, frontend developers, system
      administrators/devops, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working at a company that builds a software you'd like to hack
      on is great exposure, even if you aren't yet qualified for the
      exact work you want to do. Thankfully, over time you will likely
      have opportunities to transfer closer to the work you'd like to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my case, my focus at TigerBeetle right now is not hacking on
      the core code of TigerBeetle. But I get to write about it and
      document it and test it and build language clients and talk with
      customers and work with our devs to explain it. It's an
      incredible learning experience.
    </p>

    <h4>Spirit of building</h4>
    <p>
      The last thing I want to mention is that (in my experience,
      anyway) it helps to develop a spirit of building things you
      don't understand. Write your own React clone, write your own HTTP
      server, write your own lisp interpreter, write your own
      compiler, write your own database.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I started doing this because I just didn't like black
      boxes. I didn't like when people spoke with hesitation on
      subjects when answers *could* be discovered. I wanted to know
      how stuff worked. Or know when further knowledge was truly
      undiscoverable or impractical.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been doing that for ~10 years now so it sort of gets easier
      over time, but the subject always changes. And I get to tackle
      harder problems each time.
    </p>

    <h4>Complexity in frontend development</h4>
    <p>
      By the way, you don't have to leave frontend development to work
      on complex systems. Think about Figma or Youtube or Discord or
      other complex web UIs. These UIs can often require the same kind
      of systems discipline as working on a database.
    </p>

    <h4>Good luck!</h4>
    <p>
      My path personally was a combination of moving over time to jobs
      closer to systems programming. In no particular order. From full
      stack, to frontend, to full stack, to backend, to building my
      own company, to whatever it is you can say I'm doing now. :)
      Switching between management, tech lead, and IC positions
      throughout. All the while I challenged myself by reading books
      and building projects from scratch to teach myself. And trying
      to join companies where I'd feel like an idiot, fueling my
      desire to learn and catch up.

      You can do it! Stay in touch. And come hang
      out on <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord with
      other hackers</a> if you want!
