  This is a great question. And aside from purely personal reasons
  (family, apartment size, etc.), there are a few different things to
  consider.

<h3>Geographical hiring market tiers</h3>

<p>
  Your average company in your average US city builds a
  line-of-business app (a CRUD app). Salary probably peaks around
  $120k for a software developer. You mostly likely don't get any
  equity, but you may get a regular year-end bonus (possibly from a
  profit-sharing agreement).
</p>
<p>
  Most people at the company stay at the company for 5-10
  years. They're interested in tech and probably read Hacker News and
  /r/programming. They probably own an Arduino. But they aren't
  particularly obsessed with tech and they enjoy their home life,
  kids, and community.

  This is amazing and nothing wrong whatsoever.
