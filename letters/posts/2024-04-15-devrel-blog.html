  Hey [Redacted]! Your email is not easy to answer!
</p>

<p>
  First, I'd reiterate that my post, [What makes a great technical
  blog](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-04-10-what-makes-a-great-tech-blog.html),
  was about personal tech blogs and not about corporate tech
  blogs. You linked to your work on your company blog.
</p>

<p>
  Second, I am talking about my personal opinion. Now I think I have
  good taste. :p But again I wasn't even trying to argue for universal
  values, just sharing my personal opinion.
</p>

<p>
  Third, I would say that I don't understand capital D, DevRel, at
  all. I don't mean that as an insult to DevRel but to clarify that
  while I think there is likely value to it, I truly don't understand
  it. I can see that some people build enormous followings from
  DevRel. For example Supabase. But both the route and the audience
  don't make sense to me. I'm sure that at some point I will
  understand these.
</p>

<p>
  The thing that I focus on, including when previously leading
  marketing at TigerBeetle, is, when blogging/doing videos, talking
  solely about how the product is built. And the story having to do
  with the product and the company, the engineering team, etc.
</p>

<p>
  That doesn't mean you don't need good docs and tutorials. You
  do. But you emphasize telling interesting stories about what you,
  the people building the product, run into.
</p>

<p>
  My uninformed guess judging from your posts is that you're doing the
  former, DevRel.
</p>

<p>
  I think the two have different audiences. When you do DevRel, you
  attract the common denominator developer. When you talk about
  engineering/product challenges, you attract more experienced
  developers.
</p>

<p>
  The latter is probably the best way to build a Solid Engineering
  brand, as well as to attract Solid Engineers. The former is probably
  better for building a mass audience?
</p>

<p>
  But really as I said, when it comes to DevRel, I'm out of my depth.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, I have no clue (among these two paths, or others;
  including heavy sales-focus like Oracle or possibly EnterpriseDB) what leads to
  long-term business growth. I'm only fairly confident that my
  approach builds a strong engineering brand.
</p>

  Cheers,
