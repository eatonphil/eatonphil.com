<p>
  Sometimes I get asked questions that would be more fun to answer
  if the answers were public. All letters are treated as anonymous
  unless permission is otherwise granted.

<p>
  Writing these can be difficult but my general rule is to learn
  and share my learnings in public.

  I don't have a dedicated RSS feed for letters but I include
  all posts (notes, lists, letters, videos) in the
  <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/rss.xml">notes.eatonphil.com/rss.xml</a>
  feed.
