<p class="note">
  Sometimes I get asked questions that would be more fun to answer in
  public. All <a href="/">letters</a> are treated as anonymous unless
  permission is otherwise granted.
  <br />
  <br />
  Responses are based on my experience and opinions.
</p>

<p>
  This is a great question. I've also been thinking of the reverse
  question a lot lately: do I need to stay in NYC to have a good
  career?
</p>

<p>
  First off, let's be clear. There are any number of ways to have a
  great career. I've met many incredible developers and founders who
  live in the middle of nowhere. Plenty of people have built great
  careers and companies in small towns and cities.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, everyone has different family, health, financial,
  etc. challenges. And of course, it's fine not to want a crazy career
  either. But that's not what this question is about.
</p>

<p>
  With that said, let's talk about what can <em>improve</em> your
  chances the most if you're an ambitious developer who wants to work
  on interesting problems, make decent money, and learn a lot.
</p>

<h3 id="Geographicalhiringmarkettiers">Geographical hiring market tiers</h3>

<p>
  Let's get salaries out of the way first. As Gergely Orosz <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">has
  written</a>,
  local companies pay relatively poorly (especially non-VC-funded
  ones, and especially outside of major tech hubs). I say
  "relatively" because anyone employed as a software engineer is
  lucky, in the scheme of things.
</p>

<p>
  What he observed in Europe is absolutely my observation in the US as
  well. My first jobs were in Lancaster, PA and the nearer suburbs of
  Philadelphia, PA. I've been through this tri-modal experience. And
  there's not much to add to what Gergely wrote.
</p>

<p>
  The summary would be: try to find a company where you get equity or
  stock. This normally precludes purely local bootstrapped companies.
</p>

<h3 id="Interestingcompanies">Interesting companies</h3>

<p>
  Tech hubs are dominated by companies building CRUD apps. And yes,
  you can find companies with interesting challenges outside of tech
  hubs. But within tech hubs there is a <em>higher concentration</em>
  of companies with interesting challenges.
</p>

<p>
  Now these days, startups are getting more and more willing to hire
  strong developers wherever they are. But there still are a
  contingent not really willing to hire remotely.
</p>

<p>
  So if you want the most options among the most interesting
  companies, it might be a good idea to move to NYC or the Bay
  Area.
</p>

<p>
  And among companies with hard tech problems, the bulk are in the Bay
  Area. NYC is a somewhat distant second. Seattle, Boston, Austin,
  Atlanta, Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, LA, and likely others are other
  good choices beyond the Bay and NYC.
</p>

<h4 id="Remoteiseasierwithexperience">Remote is easier with experience</h4>

<p>
  But remember, the more in-demand your skills are and/or the more
  experience you have, the more willing companies are to let you work
  from wherever. I know many developers who live in random cities
  throughout the US and work for major tech companies. Building your
  network to find these opportunities can help.
</p>

<p>
  And although some job postings say they are for a specific location,
  it's always worth applying anyway for a position you're interested
  in. Some companies are flexible. Some aren't. Unless the company is
  famously on-prem only (like Apple or many banks), you won't know if
  you can work remotely until and unless you apply and talk to them.
</p>

<h3 id="MeetupsandCOVIDfallout">Meetups and COVID fallout</h3>

<p>
  I have huge respect for people who run meetups. But I've been to a
  number of meetups and most of them are mediocre. It takes a lot of
  effort to keep identifying good speakers. And if you don't put that
  extra effort in, the meetups end up with poorly disguised product
  ads, demos, and pitches.
</p>

<p>
  At the same time, everything is marketing. So you can't, nor should
  you necessarily try, to avoid pitches. But you can at least reward
  the companies who try hard to teach the community something. You can
  do this by attending the best meetups.
</p>

<p>
  In NYC, the best meetups (before COVID)
  were <a href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/">Papers We
  Love</a> and the
  <a href="http://www.nylug.org/">Linux User Group</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately both of these almost completely shut down since
  COVID. Papers We Love has had one meetup this year (fantastic!) but
  overall nowhere near the old frequency yet.
</p>

<h4 id="Onlinemeetupsandcommunities">Online meetups and communities</h4>

<p>
  While in-person meetups have struggled, there have been more meetups
  and discussion groups going online.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/events/">CMU Database Series</a></li>
  <li>Aleksey Charapko's <a href="http://charap.co/category/reading-group/">Distributed Systems Paper Reading Group</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://dsdsd.da.cwi.nl/">The Dutch Seminar on Data Systems Design</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://bit.ly/joindatabass">Database Internals Slack Group</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/8xp8h0/remudev_now_has_a_discord/">Emulator Development Discord</a></li>
  <li>A <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">software internals Discord</a> I run</li>
  <li>And surely much more</li>
</ul>

<p>
  And then there's the broader community on Twitter, LinkedIn
  (catching up recently as people are driven off Twitter), Hacker
  News, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/high-quality-subreddits-you-should-be-following.html">select
  subreddits</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Obviously, these are available to you no matter where you live.
</p>

<h3 id="BookclubsVCsandcoffees">Book clubs, VCs, and coffees</h3>

<p>
  There are some interesting things that can happen in person besides
  meetups though. I started an in-person <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-ddia.html">book club in
  NYC</a> this summer and it was a
  lot of fun. After so many years "hiding" at home, I was very happy
  to meet up with real people again and make new IRL connections.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing that started happening recently for me (since trying
  to start a company in 2021) was VC dinners. VCs in the areas
  occasionally invite founders and developers (among others, I'm sure)
  to networking dinners. Quite interesting. Just another chance to
  meet more local peers.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I meet a lot of random people in tech for coffee. No reason
  other than that it's fun to meet people! I'd have a harder time
  doing that if I lived in a smaller city or a place with fewer people
  in tech. Or people in more traditional tech jobs where they can't
  easily meet me for coffee.
</p>

<h3 id="Affordabilityandculture">Affordability and culture</h3>

<p>
  There's more to a city than being the biggest tech hub in the
  US. For example, housing.
</p>

<p>
  After 5-10 years of working for a tech company in Philly,
  Chicago, Austin, Minneapolis, Atlanta, or Denver, you can probably
  buy a house or family-size apartment in a walkable part of the city.
</p>

<p>
  NYC and the Bay Area are incredibly expensive. Buying a place on the
  same budget as the above cities, in a walkable area, would get you a
  studio.
</p>

<p>
  The Bay Area is often considered monocultural. Everywhere you go,
  you hear people talking about startups.
</p>

<p>
  NYC in contrast has major industries aside from tech. And many other
  major US cities listed above are dominated by finance, healthcare,
  or manufacturing.
</p>

<h3 id="Actionableideas">Actionable ideas</h3>

To summarize:

<h4 id="Joinaninterestingcompany">Join an interesting company</h4>

<p>
  First, try to join a company where you'll feel like an
  idiot. Find a place where you'll be challenged.
</p>

<p>
  Especially early on in your career, you don't know what you don't
  know. And your habits and thoughts will be heavily influenced by
  those around you.
</p>

<p>
  So find a company with smart developers. FAANG is great but this
  goes beyond FAANG.
</p>

<p>
  For me, the folks I look up to typically work at Internet
  infrastructure companies like Fly.io, CloudFlare, Cockroach, Fastly,
  AWS, Digital Ocean, Jet Brains, DataDog, ClickHouse. Cloud compute
  companies, security companies, database companies, developer tool
  companies, etc.
</p>

<p>
  And many interesting companies hire remotely. But if they don't and
  you get an offer, they'll normally pay for you to move anyway. If
  you're ready to move, go for it!
</p>

<h4 id="Joinonlinecommunities">Join online communities</h4>

<p>
  Second, join an online community or two. Even if you can't work at
  companies where you feel challenged, you can challenge yourself
  online. Networks are useful as you grow them. And the best time to
  start is now.
</p>

<h4 id="Joingoodlocalcommunities">Join good local communities</h4>

<p>
  Third, look around for the interesting companies in your area
  already! Ask a developer to get coffee with you. Encourage
  interesting local companies to host meetups or speak at them.
</p>

<p>
  Our communities are what we make of them.
</p>

<h4 id="Ultimatelywhereverisfine">Ultimately, wherever is fine</h4>

<p>
  It was a big deal for my career to move to NYC. But that was before
  I tried to find or start good online communities.
</p>

<p>
  So my ultimate answer to your question is emphatically: no, you do
  not need to move to NYC or the Bay Area to get good opportunities in
  tech.
</p>

<p>
  But doing so may make it easier for you. And I certainly have a lot
  of fun living in NYC.
