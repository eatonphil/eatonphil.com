<p>
  Hey [Redacted]! It's nice to hear from you.
</p>

<p>
  You write that you're a self-taught frontend developer who would
  like to be able to work on more complex systems like
  databases. You asked about my learning path (since my site
  mentions I started with jQuery and PHP).
</p>
<p>
  First off, ambition/desire is a powerful thing! I was a manager
  for a while and I'd watch folks across all apparent experience
  and talent levels. When they said they wanted to do something
  I'd see it gnaw at them until they did it.
</p>
<p>
  If there's something you want to do, you likely can do it. Or
  something close.
</p>
<p>
  At least in this specific case, if you are a self-taught
  frontend developer who wants to end up hacking on databases,
  that's 100% doable over the course of time if you stick with it.
</p>
<h4>Database development</h4>
<p>
  If your question was: "As an experienced developer, how do I get
  into or learn more about database development?", I'd just link
  you to
  the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/unj8d1/getting_started_with_database_development/">Getting
    started with database development</a> page on
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment">/r/databasedevelopment</a>
  that I put together with much help from Twitter friends.
</p>

<h4>Beyond frontend</h4>
<p>
  But I'm interpreting your question as a little bit more than
  what that page has to offer. Many of the topics on that page
  might be a jump from what a frontend developer commonly
  experiences.
</p>
<p>
  So other aspects of moving closer to something like hacking on
  databases might include switching to backend programming
  at work, or hacking on your own educational projects.
</p>

<h4>Ease of transfer</h4>
<p>
  It's often easiest to transfer roles within the same company, as
  opposed to getting an entirely different job at a new
  company. There are some exceptions to that. It can sometimes be
  easier to join a small(er) company with the exact role you want.
</p>
<p>
  But in general once you're inside a company you can tell your
  manager what you'd like to do in the future. You and your
  manager can find ways during your workday to get you closer
  to the goal. Maybe you'll take on small projects with another
  team. Or dedicate 20% of your time to another team. And so
  on.
</p>

<h4>Non-core development roles at database companies</h4>
<p>
  One more approach to consider is that database companies are
  often SaaS companies. Or at least they need to build web
  management portals (hosted somewhere).
</p>
<p>
  That means that database companies employ all the same positions as
  other software companies: designers, frontend developers, system
  administrators/devops, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Working at a company that builds a software you'd like to hack
  on is great exposure, even if you aren't yet qualified for the
  exact work you want to do. Thankfully, over time you will likely
  have opportunities to transfer closer to the work you'd like to
  do.
</p>
<p>
  In my case, my focus at TigerBeetle right now is not hacking on
  the core code of TigerBeetle. But I get to write about it and
  document it and test it and build language clients and talk with
  customers and work with our devs to explain it. It's an
  incredible learning experience.
</p>

<h4>Spirit of building</h4>
<p>
  The last thing I want to mention is that (in my experience,
  anyway) it helps to develop a spirit of building things you
  don't understand. Write your own React clone, write your own HTTP
  server, write your own lisp interpreter, write your own
  compiler, write your own database.
</p>
<p>
  I think I started doing this because I just didn't like black
  boxes. I didn't like when people spoke with hesitation on
  subjects when answers *could* be discovered. I wanted to know
  how stuff worked. Or know when further knowledge was truly
  undiscoverable or impractical.
</p>
<p>
  I've been doing that for ~10 years now so it sort of gets easier
  over time, but the subject always changes. And I get to tackle
  harder problems each time.
</p>

<h4>Complexity in frontend development</h4>
<p>
  By the way, you don't have to leave frontend development to work
  on complex systems. Think about Figma or Youtube or Discord or
  other complex web UIs. These UIs can often require the same kind
  of systems discipline as working on a database.
</p>

<h4>Good luck!</h4>
<p>
  My path personally was a combination of moving over time to jobs
  closer to systems programming. In no particular order. From full
  stack, to frontend, to full stack, to backend, to building my
  own company, to whatever it is you can say I'm doing now. :)
  Switching between management, tech lead, and IC positions
  throughout. All the while I challenged myself by reading books
  and building projects from scratch to teach myself. And trying
  to join companies where I'd feel like an idiot, fueling my
  desire to learn and catch up.
</p>
<p>
  You can do it! Stay in touch. And come hang
  out on <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord with
    other hackers</a> if you want!
</p>
