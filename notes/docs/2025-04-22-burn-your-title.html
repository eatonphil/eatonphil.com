          <p>I've been a developer, a manager, a cofounder, and now I'm a developer
again. I ran away from each position until being a founder because I
felt like I was limited by what I was allowed to do.</p>
<p>But I reached an enlightment of sorts during my career progression:
that everyone around me was dying for someone to pick things up, for
employees to show engagement and agency.</p>
<p>We think of our titles as our limits. We're quick to say and believe,
"that isn't my job". While in reality titles reflect the minimum
expected of us, not the maximum that is open to us.</p>
<h3 id="moving-your-career-forward">Moving your career forward</h3><p>Trying to figure out what (new minimum) you must do to get promoted
seems kind of backwards to me, reinforcing our sense of our own
limits. Instead, at every stage in your career, focus on doing the
intersection of:</p>
<ul>
<li>what you see needs to be done (that isn't being done)</li>
<li>what you are capable of doing</li>
<li>what you have the desire/energy (or would find fulfillment) doing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is the path to promotion and a successful and interesting
career.</p>
<p>Burn your title. Burn your job description. I mean, keep your boss
happy for sure. Keep your teammates happy by supporting them and
building them up and communicating well. But don't wait to be
officially made a lead or given a new title to do what otherwise fits
into that intersection above.</p>
<p>And if after doing this for some time, demonstrating this level of
agency, you are not promoted, it just means you're not at the right
company or right organization within your company and you should look
elsewhere.</p>
<p>What's more, this work you did (at a company that doesn't appreciate
your agency, if that happens to be the case) merely makes the case
stronger for your successful interview at the next company. There's no
downside.</p>
<p>The cynical, and perhaps realistic, alternative to this is to do
politics to get promoted. Or to not do politics but to do things
that don't align with your long-term goals. I'm not personally
interested in either path so I'm not covering them here. I'm
interested in the intersection of things that move me in the direction
I want, things that are useful to the company, and things that I am
capable of doing (in addition to whatever minimum work I must actually
do).</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><p>Here's a peek at what this looks like for me as an individual
contributor, a programmer, at EnterpriseDB.</p>
<p>I started the EDB Engineering Newsletter because it seemed like we
needed to do a better job telling the world the awesome things our
engineering team is doing. (You know we're one of the biggest
contributors to Postgres? Bruce Momjian, Robert Haas, Peter
Eisentraut, etc. work here? The guy who implemented the WAL and MVCC
in Postgres is my teammate?) Nobody asked me to do that.</p>
<p>I started publishing blog views for the entire company once a month
internally. Nobody asked me to do that.</p>
<p>I wrote a number of internal docs and tutorials on the product because
we were just obviously missing them. Nobody asked me to do that.</p>
<p>I started a fortnightly incident review meeting for my team because it
seemed like we were missing chances to update docs and teach each
other. Nobody asked me to do that.</p>
<p>I write a odd posts for the company blog on what I've learned. Nobody
asked me to do that.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the random things that seemed like a good idea
for me to do on top of my Actual Work as a developer, which I think I
do a decent job of on its own.</p>
<h3 id="in-closing">In closing</h3><p>Don't burn out. Don't do things you aren't asked for and don't find
rewarding. Or that won't pave the way toward the career you want. I'm
trying to be very careful not to advocate anything along those lines.</p>
<p>But also don't wait to be asked to do something. Do what is
interesting and obvious and rewarding to you. Interesting
opportunities seem to come most reliably when you make them for
yourself.</p>
