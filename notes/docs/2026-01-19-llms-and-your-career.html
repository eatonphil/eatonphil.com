          <p>The most conservative way to build a career as a software developer is
1) to be practical and effective at problem solving but 2) not to
treat all existing code as a black box. 1 means that as a conservative
developer you should generally use PostgreSQL or MySQL (or whatever
existing database), Rails or .NET (or whatever existing framework),
and adapt code from Stack Overflow or LLMs. 2 means that you're
curious and work over time to better understand how web servers and
databases and operating systems and the browser actually work so that
you can make better decisions for your own problems as you adapt other
people's code and ideas.</p>
<p>Coding via LLM is not fundamentally different from coding with Rails
or coding by perusing Stack Overflow. It's faster and more direct but
it's still potentially just a human mindlessly adapting existing code.</p>
<p>The people who were only willing to look at existing frameworks and
libraries and applications as black boxes were already not the most
competitive when it came to finding and retaining work. And on the
other hand, the most technically interesting companies always wanted
to hire developers who understood fundamentals because they're 1)
operating at such a scale that the way the application is written
matters or they're 2) building PostgreSQL or MySQL or Rails or .NET or
Stack Overflow or LLMs, etc.</p>
<p>The march of software has always been to reduce the need for (ever
larger sizes of) SMBs (and teams within non-SMBs) to hire developers
to solve problems or increase productivity. LLMs are part of that
march. That doesn't change that at some point companies (or teams)
need to hire developers because the business or its customer base has
become too complex or too large.</p>
<p>The jobs that were dependent on fundamentals of software aren't going
to stop being dependent on fundamentals of software. And if more
non-developers are using LLMs it's going to mean all the more stress
on tools and applications and systems that rely on fundamentals of
software.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that if you like doing software development, I
don't think interesting software development jobs are going to go
away. So keep learning and keep building compilers and databases and
operating systems and keep looking for companies that have compiler
and database and operating system products.</p>
