          <p>I quit my job at EnterpriseDB hacking on PostgreSQL products last
month to start a company researching and writing about software
infrastructure. I believe there is space for analysis that is more
focused on code than TechCrunch or The Register, more open to covering
corporate software development than LWN.net, and (as much as I love
some of these folks) less biased than VCs writing about their own
investments.</p>
<p>I believe that more than ever there is a need for authentic and
trustworthy analysis and coverage of the software we depend on.</p>
<p>This company, <a href="https://theconsensus.dev">The Consensus</a>, will talk
about databases and programming languages and web servers and
everything else that is important for experienced developers to
understand and think about. It is independent of any software vendor
and independent of any particular technology.</p>
<p>Some people were
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7426321013795229696?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7426321013795229696%2C7426362937499508736%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287426362937499508736%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7426321013795229696%29">surprised</a>
(in a positive way) to see me cover MySQL already, for example. But
that is exactly the point.</p>
<p>I don't want The Consensus to be just "Phil's thoughts". I have already
started working with a number of experienced developers who will be
writing, and paid to write, for The Consensus.</p>
<p>I also hope that this is another way, beyond the many communities I
already run, to give back to the community such as in highlighting the
work of open-source developers (the first interview with a DataFusion
developer is coming soon), and highlighting compelling events and jobs
in the software infrastructure world.</p>
<p>The Consensus is entirely bootstrapped and will depend on the support of
subscribers and, potentially, sponsors. The first few subscribers
signed up just this past week.</p>
<p>You can read more about the background and goals
<a href="https://theconsensus.dev/about.html">here</a>, you can read about how
contributors will work with The Consensus
<a href="https://theconsensus.dev/contribute.html">here</a>, and you can get a
sense for where this is going by browsing the homepage of The
Consensus already.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support in advance! Thank you to the folks who have
subscribed already despite very little fanfare.</p>
<p>Feedback is very welcome.</p>
<p>I'm very excited and having quite a bit of fun already. We're
all going to learn a lot.</p>
