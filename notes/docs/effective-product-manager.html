          <p>There are three specific activities I have loved in some product
managers I've worked with (and missed in others).</p>
<p>tldr;</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk with customers and prospects</li>
<li>Develop and share a vision</li>
<li>Evangelize</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="talk-with-customers-and-prospects">Talk with customers and prospects</h3><p>As a product manager, your superpower over engineering is to have
spent time with customers and prospects. You should have (or develop)
a good understanding of the market and your product's potential.</p>
<p>The only way you can do this is by spending time, over time, with
customers and prospects. Understanding their workflows and their
issues.</p>
<h3 id="develop-and-share-a-vision">Develop and share a vision</h3><p>Cynical folks will cringe at the word "vision" but it is a serious and
necessary part of a successful organization.</p>
<p>As a product manager, you should establish and share a path for
engineering to follow based on your understanding of customers,
prospects, the market, and the company.</p>
<p>This is the "roadmap" and "prioritization". But prioritization is
useless without a long-term vision.</p>
<p>The roadmap should represent (and broadly demonstrate) a concrete and
meaningful goal. A goal that you can and should adjust over time as
the company and market changes.</p>
<h3 id="evangelize">Evangelize</h3><p>In bigger organizations there might be dedicated evangelism teams. But
product managers must drive this work.</p>
<p>Evangelism should fit the vision you've developed.</p>
<p>And in the absense of dedicated evangelism teams, product managers
should be creating demos, writing blog posts, and testing the solution
with customers and prospects.</p>
<p>Again, it's fine for dedicated teams outside of product management to
do bits of that work. But it must be driven and led by the product
manager.</p>
<h3 id="it's-hard">It's hard</h3><p>Observed as I have from outside, being an effective product
manager feels like a massively challenging task.</p>
<p>It's so easy to go without talking to customers, to get sucked into
day-to-day issues and not create a vision, and to allow evangelism to
happen ad-hoc.</p>
<p>Then there's the fact you don't live in a vacuum. You may have a boss
in product management. Your engineering peers may have competing
priorities. You may have a hard time understanding the founders or
CEO. In a large company, you may not even have a CEO.</p>
<h3 id="my-ideas,-your-ideas">My ideas, your ideas</h3><p>These are my ideas based on my
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/">experience</a>. You may have your own ideas. If
mine help you, great! If they don't, great!</p>
