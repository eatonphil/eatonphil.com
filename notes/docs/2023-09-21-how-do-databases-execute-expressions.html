          <p>Databases are fun. They sit at the confluence of Computer
Science topics that might otherwise not seem practical in life as a
developer. For example, every database with a query language is also a
programming language implementation of some caliber. That doesn't
include all databases though of course; see: RocksDB, FoundationDB,
TigerBeetle, etc.</p>
<p>This post looks at how various databases execute expressions in their
query language.</p>
<p>tldr; Most surveyed databases use a tree-walking interpreter. A few
use stack- or register-based virtual machines. A couple have
just-in-time compilers. And, tangentially, a few do vectorized
interpretation.</p>
<p class="note">
  Throughout this post I'll use "virtual machine" as a shorthand for
  stack- or register-based loops that process a linearized
  set of instructions. I say this since it is sometimes fair to call a
  tree-walking interpreter a virtual machine. But that is not what I
  mean when I say virtual machine in this post.
</p><h3 id="stepping-back">Stepping back</h3><p>Programming languages are typically implemented by turning an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a linear set of instructions
for a virtual machine (e.g. CPython, Java, C#) or native code
(e.g. GCC's C compiler, Go, Rust). Some of the former implementations
also generate and run Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled native code
(e.g. Java and C#).</p>
<p>Less commonly these days in programming languages does the
implementation interpret off the AST or some other tree-like
intermediate representation. This style is often called
tree-walking.</p>
<p>Shell languages sometimes do tree-walking. Otherwise, implementations
that interpret directly off of a tree normally do so as a short-term
measure before switching to compiled virtual machine code or JIT-ed
native code (e.g. some JavaScript implementations, GraalVM, RPython,
etc.)</p>
<p>That is, while some major programming language implementations started
out with tree-walking interpreters, they mostly moved away from solely
tree-walking over a decade ago. See <a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/">JSC in
2008</a>, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/12/ruby-19/">Ruby
in 2007</a>, etc.</p>
<p>My intuition is that tree-walking takes up more memory and is less
cache-friendly than the linear instructions you give to a virtual
machine or to your CPU. There are <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla23-larose-et-al-ast-vs-bytecode-interpreters-in-the-age-of-meta-compilation.pdf">some folks who
disagree</a>,
but they mostly talk about tree-walking when you've also got a JIT
compiler hooked up. Which isn't quite the same thing. There has also
been <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html">some early exploration and
improvements</a>
reported when tree-walking with a tree organized as an array.</p>
<h4 id="and-databases?">And databases?</h4><p>Databases often interpret directly off a tree. (It isn't, generally
speaking, fair to say they are AST-walking interpreters because
databases typically transform and optimize beyond just an AST as
parsed from user code.)</p>
<p>But not all databases interpret a tree. Some have a virtual
machine. And some generate and run JIT-ed native code.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3><p>If a core function (in the query execution path that does something
like arithmetic or comparison) returns a value, that's a sign it's a
tree-walking interpreter. Or, if you see code that is evaluating its
arguments during execution, that's also a sign of a tree-walking
interpreter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the function mutates internal state such as by
assigning a value to a context or pushing to a stack, that's a sign
it's a stack- or register-based virtual machine. If a function pulls
its arguments from memory and doesn't evaluate the arguments, that's
also an indication it's a stack- or register-based virtual machine.</p>
<p>This approach can result in false-positives depending on the
architecture of the interpreter. User-defined functions (UDFs) would
probably accept evaluated arguments and return a value regardless of
how the interpreter is implemented. So it's important to find not just
functions that could be implemented like UDFs, but core builtin
behavior. Control flow implementations of functions like <code>if</code> or
<code>case</code> can be great places to look.</p>
<p>And tactically, I clone the source code and run stuff like <code>git grep
-i eval | grep -v test | grep \\.java | grep -i eval</code> or <code>git grep -i
expr | grep -v test | grep \\.go | grep -i expr</code> until I convince
myself I'm somewhere interesting.</p>
<p>Note: In talking about a broad swath of projects, maybe I've
misunderstood one or some. If you've got a correction, let me know! If
there's a proprietary database you work on where you can link to the
(publicly described) execution strategy, feel free to pass it along!
Or if I'm missing your public-source database in this list, send me a
message!</p>
<h3 id="survey">Survey</h3><h4><a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach">Cockroach</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>Judging by functions like <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/sem/eval/expr.go#L105"><code>func (e *evaluator)
EvalBinaryExpr</code></a>
that <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/sem/eval/expr.go#L106">evaluates the left-hand
side</a>
and then <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/sem/eval/expr.go#L113">evaluates the right-hand
side</a>
and returns a value, Cockroach looks like a tree walking interpreter.</p>
<p>It gets a little more interesting though, since Cockroach also
<a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/vectorized-execution">supports</a>
vectorized expression execution. Vectorizing is a fancy term for
acting on many pieces of data at once rather than one at a time. It
doesn't necessarily imply SIMD. Here is an example of a <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/colexec/colexecproj/proj_non_const_ops.eg.go#L4427">vectorized
addition</a>
of two int64 columns.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse">ClickHouse</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker + JIT)</h4><p>The ClickHouse architecture is a little unique and difficult for me to
read through – likely due to it being fairly mature, with serious
optimization. But they tend to document their header files well. So
files like
<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/853e3f0aa789d5b6dcb251a403276d9fdc02902c/src/Functions/IFunction.h">src/Functions/IFunction.h</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/9af9b4a08542812694f171833a7afe08f5aaaafb/src/Interpreters/ExpressionActions.h">src/Interpreters/ExpressionActions.h</a>
were helpful.</p>
<p>They have also spoken publicly about their pipeline execution model;
e.g. <a href="https://presentations.clickhouse.com/meetup24/5.%20Clickhouse%20query%20execution%20pipeline%20changes/">this
presentation</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/34045">this roadmap
issue</a>. But it
isn't completely clear how much pipeline execution (which is broader
than just expression evaluation) connects to expression evaluation.</p>
<p>Moreover, they have <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-just-in-time-compiler-jit">publicly
spoken</a>
about their support for JIT compilation for query execution. But let's
look at how execution works when the JIT is not enabled. For example,
If we take a look at how <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/853e3f0aa789d5b6dcb251a403276d9fdc02902c/src/Functions/if.cpp"><code>if</code> is
implemented</a>,
we know that the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> rows must be conditionally
evaluated.</p>
<p>In the runtime entrypoint,
<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/853e3f0aa789d5b6dcb251a403276d9fdc02902c/src/Functions/if.cpp#L1048"><code>executeImpl</code></a>,
we see the function call
<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/853e3f0aa789d5b6dcb251a403276d9fdc02902c/src/Functions/if.cpp#L983"><code>executeShortCircuitArguments</code></a>
which in turn calls
<a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Columns/ColumnFunction.cpp#L280"><code>ColumnFunction::reduce()</code></a>
which <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Columns/ColumnFunction.cpp#L299">evaluates each column vector that is an
argument</a>
to the function and then calls execute on the function.</p>
<p>So from this we can tell the non-JIT execution is a tree walker and
that it is over <a href="https://twitter.com/ClickHouseDB/status/1705619463888900538">chunks of
columns</a>,
i.e. vectorized data, similar to Cockroach. However in ClickHouse
execution is <em>always</em> over column vectors.</p>
<p class="note">
  In the original version of this post, I had some confusion about the
  ClickHouse execution strategy. Robert Schulze from
  ClickHouse <a href="https://clickhousedb.slack.com/archives/CUDSPUJ68/p1695307656700889">helped
  clarify</a> things for me. Thanks Robert!
</p><h4><a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb">DuckDB</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>If we take a look at how <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/479c89e154f32012143d741c1a4f4d769f20044e/src/execution/expression_executor/execute_function.cpp#L59">function expressions are
executed</a>,
we can see each <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/479c89e154f32012143d741c1a4f4d769f20044e/src/execution/expression_executor/execute_function.cpp#L66">argument in the function being
evaluated</a>
before being passed to the actual function. So that looks like a tree
walking interpreter.</p>
<p>Like ClickHouse, DuckDB expression execution is always over column
vectors. You can read more about this architecture
<a href="https://duckdb.org/internals/vector.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/analytical-data-management-duckdb/">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">Influx</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>Influx originally had a SQL-like query language called InfluxQL. If we
look at <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/b3b982d746fdc34451ca44d262f83b483cd9ea33/storage/reads/influxql_eval.go#L41">how it evaluates a binary
expression</a>,
it first evaluates the left-hand side and then the right-hand side
before operating on the sides and returning a value. That's a
tree-walking interpreter.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/flux">Flux</a> was the new query language
for Influx. While the Flux
<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/master/docs/VirtualMachine.md">docs</a>
suggest they transform to an intermediate representation that is
executed on a virtual machine, there's nothing I'm seeing that looks
like a stack- or register-based virtual machine. All the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/master/interpreter/interpreter.go#L352">evaluation
functions</a>
evaluate their arguments and return a value. That looks like a
tree-walking interpreter to me.</p>
<p>Today Influx
<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/blog/the-plan-for-influxdb-3-0-open-source/">announced</a>
that Flux is in maintenance mode and they are focusing on InfluxQL
again.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server">MariaDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server">MySQL</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>Control flow methods are normally a good way to see how an interpreter
is implemented. The implementation of COALESCE <a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server/blob/e9573c059656d9477c2176f102f7e79d0f1ca6b0/sql/item_cmpfunc.cc#L3431">looks pretty
simple</a>. We
see it <a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server/blob/e9573c059656d9477c2176f102f7e79d0f1ca6b0/sql/item_cmpfunc.cc#L3442">call
<code>val_str()</code></a>
for each argument to COALESCE. But I can only seem to find
implementations of <code>val_str()</code> on raw values and not
expressions. <code>Item_func_coalesce</code> itself does not implement
<code>val_str()</code> for example, which would be a strong indication of a tree
walker. Maybe it does implement <code>val_str()</code> through inheritance.</p>
<p>It becomes a little clearer if we look at non-control flow methods
like
<a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server/blob/e9573c059656d9477c2176f102f7e79d0f1ca6b0/sql/item_func.cc#L2048"><code>acos</code></a>. In
this method we see <code>Item_func_acos</code> itself implement <code>val_real()</code> and
also call <code>val_real()</code> on all its arguments. In this case it's obvious
how the control flow of <code>acos(acos(.5))</code> would work. So that seems to
indicate expressions are executed with a tree walking interpreter.</p>
<p>I also noticed
<a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/server/blob/e9573c059656d9477c2176f102f7e79d0f1ca6b0/sql/sp_instr.cc">sql/sp_instr.cc</a>. That
is scary (in terms of invalidating my analysis) since it looks like a
virtual machine. But after looking through it, I think this virtual
machine only corresponds to how stored procedures are executed, hence
the <code>sp_</code> prefix for Stored Programs. <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/stored_programs.html">MySQL
docs</a>
also explain that stored procedures are executed with a bytecode
virtual machine.</p>
<p>I'm curious why they don't use that virtual machine for query
execution.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell MySQL and MariaDB do not differ in this regard.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo">MongoDB</a> (Ruling: Virtual Machine)</h4><p>Mongo <a href="https://laplab.me/posts/inside-new-query-engine-of-mongodb/">recently
introduced</a>
a virtual machine for executing queries, called Slot Based Execution
(SBE). We can find the SBE code in
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/exec/sbe/vm/vm.cpp#L9313">src/mongo/db/exec/sbe/vm/vm.cpp</a>
and the main virtual machine entrypoint
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/exec/sbe/vm/vm.cpp#L9313">here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/exec/sbe/vm/vm.cpp#L9419">Looks
like</a>
a classic stack-based virtual machine!</p>
<p>It isn't completely clear to me if the SBE path is always used or if
there are still cases where it falls back to their old execution
model. You can read more about Mongo execution
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/query/README.md">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/sbe/">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a hjef="https://github.com/postgres/postgres">PostgreSQL</a> (Ruling: Virtual Machine + JIT)</h4><p>The top of PostgreSQL's
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/cca97ce6a6653df7f4ec71ecd54944cc9a6c4c16/src/backend/executor/execExprInterp.c#L6">src/backend/executor/execExprInterp.c</a>
clearly explains that expression execution uses a virtual machine. You
see all the hallmarks: opcodes, a loop over a giant switch, etc. And
if we look at how <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/cca97ce6a6653df7f4ec71ecd54944cc9a6c4c16/src/backend/executor/execExprInterp.c#L728">function expressions are
executed</a>,
we see another hallmark which is that the function expression code
doesn't evaluate its arguments. They've already been evaluated. And
function expression code just acts on the results of its arguments.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL also
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/jit/README">supports</a>
JIT-ing expression execution. And we can find the switch between
interpreting and JIT-compiling an expression
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/cca97ce6a6653df7f4ec71ecd54944cc9a6c4c16/src/backend/executor/execExpr.c#L873">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb">QuestDB</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker + JIT)</h4><p>QuestDB <a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/">wrote about their execution engine
recently</a>. When
the conditions are right, they'll <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/11ac85510292596f0d21b10603e500f8edb5e486/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/griffin/SqlCodeGenerator.java#L1394">switch over to a JIT
compiler</a>
and run native code.</p>
<p>But let's look at the default path. For example, how <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/11ac85510292596f0d21b10603e500f8edb5e486/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/griffin/engine/functions/bool/AndFunctionFactory.java#L82"><code>AND</code> is
implemented</a>. <code>AndBooleanFunction</code>
implements <code>BooleanFunction</code> which implements <code>Function</code>. An
expression can be evaluated by calling a <code>getX()</code> method on the
expression type that implements <code>Function</code>. <code>AndBooleanFunction</code> calls
<code>getBool()</code> on its left and right hand sides. And if we look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/11ac85510292596f0d21b10603e500f8edb5e486/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/griffin/engine/functions/BooleanFunction.java#L35">partial
implementation</a>
of <code>BooleanFunction</code> we'll also see it doing <code>getX()</code> specific
conversions during the call of <code>getX()</code>. So that's a tree-walking
interpreter.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb">Scylla</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>If we take a look at how <a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/blob/08197882074227edbd0a95f49914913e3124753d/cql3/expr/expression.cc#L2145">functions are
evaluated</a>
in Scylla, we see function evaluation first <a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/blob/08197882074227edbd0a95f49914913e3124753d/cql3/expr/expression.cc#L2161">evaluating all of its
arguments</a>. And
the function evaluation function itself returns a
<code>cql3::raw_value</code>. So that's a tree-walking interpreter.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite">SQLite</a> (Ruling: Virtual Machine)</h4><p>SQLite's virtual machine is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html">comprehensive and
well-documented</a>. It encompasses
more than just expression evaluation but the entirety of query
execution.</p>
<p>We can find the massive virtual machine switch in
<a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/8aaf63c6ac8b8292c0ecead0d2b04b68e9e6be78/src/vdbe.c#L971">src/vdbe.c</a>.</p>
<p>And if we look, for example, at how <code>AND</code> is implemented, we see it
<a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/8aaf63c6ac8b8292c0ecead0d2b04b68e9e6be78/src/vdbe.c#L2536">pulling its arguments out of
memory</a>
(already evaluated) and assigning the result back to <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/8aaf63c6ac8b8292c0ecead0d2b04b68e9e6be78/src/vdbe.c#L2545">a designated
point in
memory</a>.</p>
<h4>SingleStore (Ruling: Virtual Machine + JIT)</h4><p>While there's no source code to link to, SingleStore <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vloWsdPCDs&amp;t=3810s">gave a talk at
CMU</a> that broke
down their query execution pipeline. Their
<a href="https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/query-data/advanced-query-topics/code-generation/">docs</a>
also cover the topic.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/memsql.webp" alt="SingleStore compiler pipeline"></p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb">TiDB</a> (Ruling: Tree Walker)</h4><p>Similar to DuckDB and ClickHouse, TiDB implements vectorized
interpretation. They've <a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/10x-performance-improvement-for-expression-evaluation-made-possible-by-vectorized-execution/">written publicly about their switch to this
method</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how <code>if</code> is implemented in TiDB. There is a
vectorized and non-vectorized version of <code>if</code> (in
<a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/3ccd09e63addddeb0d33b5b87594a2d61fffd1d8/expression/builtin_control.go">expression/control_builtin.go</a>
and

respectively). So maybe they haven't completely switched over to
vectorized execution or maybe it can only be used in some conditions.</p>
<p>If we look at the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/3ccd09e63addddeb0d33b5b87594a2d61fffd1d8/expression/builtin_control.go#L599">non-vectorized version of
<code>if</code></a>,
we see the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/3ccd09e63addddeb0d33b5b87594a2d61fffd1d8/expression/builtin_control.go#L600">condition
evaluated</a>. And
then the <code>then</code> or <code>else</code> is evaluated <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/3ccd09e63addddeb0d33b5b87594a2d61fffd1d8/expression/builtin_control.go#L604">depending on the result of the
condition</a>. That's
a tree-walking interpreter.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>As the DuckDB team <a href="https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html">points out</a>,
vectorized interpretation or JIT compilation <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2209-kersten.pdf">seem like the
future</a> for
database expression execution. These strategies seem particularly
important for analytics or time-series workloads. But vectorized
interpretation seems to make the most sense for column-wise storage
engines. And column-wise storage normally only makes sense for
analytics workloads. Still, TiDB and Cockroach are transactional
databases that also vectorize execution.</p>
<p>And while SQLite and PostgreSQL use the virtual machine model, it's
possible databases with tree-walking interpreters like Scylla and
MySQL/MariaDB have decided there is not significant enough gains to be
had (for transactional workloads) to justify the complexity of moving
to a compiler + virtual machine architecture.</p>
<p>Tree-walking interpreters and virtual machines are also independent
from whether or not execution is vectorized. So that will be another
interesting dimension to watch: if more databases move toward
vectorized execution even if they don't adapt JIT compilation.</p>
<p>Yet another alternative is that maybe as databases mature we'll see
compilation tiers similar to what <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9329/a-new-bytecode-format-for-javascriptcore/">browsers
do</a>
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug">with JavaScript</a>.</p>
