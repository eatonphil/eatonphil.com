          <p>This post goes out to anyone who leads a team: managers, directors,
VPs, executives. You need to share organization success stories with
your organization on a regular and frequent basis. Talk about sales
wins, talk about new services released, talk about the positive impact
of a recent organizational change. Just get in front of your entire
organization and tell them how the organization is making a positive
difference.</p>
<p>Do this at least every other week.</p>
<p>And in case it's not clear, by "success stories" I don't mean nonsense,
or opinions. I mean concrete, measurable things that moved the
organization forward.</p>
<p>Everyone in your organization is contributing to these stories and
it's your job to feed the stories back.</p>
<p>Leaders have a tendency to hear about successes but don't always
remember to propagate the stories down. I've been guilty of this
myself. This post is your (and my own) friendly reminder.</p>
<p>If you don't keep reminding your folks their organization is making a
positive impact, they're going to forget it. You'll miss out on the
freely available chance to give reassurance to your best people.</p>
<p>Talented folks want to be invested in an organization that is
succeeding.</p>
