          <p>You acquire a skill or experience through time and effort,
then downplay the impact of writing and sharing the learning
process.</p>
<p>Professionals seem naturally to imagine a high bar for what
is worth writing about.</p>
<p>I think that's misguided. This article is not criticism of folks with
these beliefs, but rather encouragement for folks looking for a reason
to write.</p>
<p>There are (at least) a few concrete reasons to write about what you've
learned, even when you don't think it's novel.</p>
<h3 id="to-practice-writing">To practice writing</h3><p>This is the easiest reason. While practice does not imply improvement,
you cannot improve without practice.</p>
<p>Every time you learn something is a chance to write down both what
you've learned and also how you learned it.</p>
<p>For professional developers this chance happens all the time. Daily,
really. But most developers, even those who want to write more, let
the opportunity slip.</p>
<h3 id="providing-variety">Providing variety</h3><p>When I learn a topic I normally go through dozens of posts, papers,
docs, videos or books to find a version that clicks. If I can. I
prefer to start with blog posts and often there are not blog posts on
the subject. Books, docs, videos, and academic papers aren't often as
accessible.</p>
<p>Even if you're writing about a popular topic, there's still a chance
your post gets through to someone in a way other posts do not.</p>
<p class="note">
  For programmers there are notorious topics you can avoid if
  you'd like ("What is a monad", "Why is lisp interesting", "Kubernetes
  sucks"). Or not. I've fallen into those traps.
</p><p>Additionally, as you gain experience as a programmer (or product
manager, or whatever), your perspective and approach becomes both more
interesting and more valuable.</p>
<p>I don't recall ever thinking: "I wish they'd write less". But I'm
always wishing some folks wrote more, or at all.</p>
<p>Some folks with experience, writing about widely varied topics in
software include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">Eli Bendersky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/03/19/">Chris Wellons</a></li>
<li>And <a href="https://zserge.com/">Serge Zaitsev</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But experience need not be a prerequisite. Experts (who don't practice
explaining) easily forget how they came to their current
understanding. A beginner's experience is valuable for everyone who is
not a beginner, sometimes also for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="to-cement-understanding">To cement understanding</h3><p>Finally, honest writing <em>forces</em> you to either understand the dark
corners of what you've learned or to ask for help in these dark
corners.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly wrestled with topics in software only to be further
forced to explain <em>why</em> (or <em>how</em>) when I write.</p>
<p>And it has often forced me to restructure code or ideas in ways that
are easier to explain. I think that's a pretty valuable act for the
long-term.</p>
<h3 id="bad-faith">Bad faith</h3><p>There's a bad faith argument that you sometimes see. Here's a
variation that comes to mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>The internet is already full of crap. People who aren't experts are
  just making it worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you ignore these comments. :) If there's a quality problem that
is genuinely causing harm, that's for search engines and trade
organizations to deal with.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-extreme">In the extreme</h3><p><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison's TIL</a> site is the
most prolific version of this I've ever seen. I don't know if I
personally aspire to Simon's level, but I think it's worth seeing.</p>
<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3><p>Some topics I think are always worth writing about and sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your process, failures and successes, to figuring something out</li>
<li>How to hack on some major open source project</li>
<li>In-depth comparison of projects or approaches, down to source code, benchmarks, and architecture when relevant</li>
<li>Building minimal versions of some production system</li>
<li>How some major systems works under the hood, down to the code</li>
<li>Mistakes you made in structuring organizations, or production architecture, or testing, etc.</li>
<li>How to get the dang configuration right for testing Electron apps in Github Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>For programming posts specifically: I strongly encourage you to
include or walk through working code. Have tests. And have the code
build process hooked up to GitHub Actions or SourceHut CI or
whatever. This helps ensure your work is still relevant over time.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-write">When you write</h3><p>Write to explain and teach. When you don't understand something, call
out that you don't understand it. That's not a bad thing, and the
internet is normally happy to help.</p>
<p>Don't shy away from showing code, showing things that broke, showing
the ugly process. It's encouraging for others to see.</p>
<h3 id="end-goal">End goal</h3><p>Well, ideally we have fewer clickbait "5 best React alternatives"
articles and more thoughtful pieces intended to teach and educate with
a bit of rigor.</p>
<p>It's better for individuals and for companies. It's better for the
internet.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3><p>If you want a community of folks where you can find encouragement to
write and eyes to review drafts, check out the #writing-and-drafts
channel on the <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Software Internals Discord</a>.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-worth-writing-about?">Is it worth writing about?</h3><p>Well if you come to me I'm almost surely going to say yes. Poor
Betteridge.</p>
