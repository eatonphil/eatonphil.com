          <p>I was delighted to notice this morning that this site has recently
passed 1M page views. And since Murat
<a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2017/02/1-million-pageviews.html">wrote</a>
about his 1M page view accomplishment at the time, I felt compelled to
now too.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/1m-page-views.png" alt="/assets/1m-page-views.png"></p>
<p>I started regularly blogging in 2018. For some reason I decided to
write a blog post every month. And while I have definitely skipped a
month or two here or there, on average I've written 2 posts per month.</p>
<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3><p>Since at least 2018 this site has been built with a static site
generator. I might have used a 3rd-party generator at one point, but
for as long as I can remember most of this site has been built with a
<a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/eatonphil.com/blob/main/notes/scripts/build.py">little Python
script</a>
I wrote.</p>
<p>I used to get so pissed when static site generators would pointlessly
change their APIs and I'd have to make pointless changes. I have not
had to make any significant changes to my build code in many years.</p>
<p>I hosted the site itself on GitHub Pages for many years. But I wanted
more flexibility with subdomains (ultimately not something I liked)
and the ability to view server-side logs (ultimately not something I
ever do).</p>
<p>I think this site is hosted on an OVH machine now. But at this point
it is inertia keeping me there. If you have no strong feelings
otherwise, GitHub Pages is perfect.</p>
<p>I used to use Google Analytics but then they shut down the old
version. The new version was incredibly confusing to use. I could not
find some very basic information. So I moved to Fathom which has been
great.</p>
<p>I used to track all subscribers in a Google Form and bcc them but this
became untenable eventually after 1000 subscribers due to GMail rate
limits. I currently use MailerLite for subscriptions and sending email
about new posts. But this is an absolutely terrible service. They
proxy all links behind a domain that adblockers hate and they also
visually shorten the URL so you can't copy the text of the URL.</p>
<p>I just want a service that has a hosted form for collecting
subscribers and a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> that lets me dump raw HTML and send
that as an email to my subscribers. No branding, no watermarks, no
link proxying. This apparently doesn't exist. I am too lazy to
figure out Amazon SES so I stick with MailerLite for now.</p>
<h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3><p>In the beginning I talked about little interpreters in JavaScript,
about programming languages, about Scheme. I was into functional
programming. Over time I moved into little emulators and bytecode
VMs. And for the last four years I became obsessed with databases and
distributed systems.</p>
<p>I have almost always written about little projects to teach myself a
concept. Writing a <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/lua-in-rust.html">bytecode VM in
Rust</a>, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/emulating-amd64-starting-with-elf.html">emulating a
subset of x86 in
Go</a>,
<a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-05-25-raft.html">implementing Raft in
Go</a>, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-05-16-mvcc.html">implementing
MVCC isolation levels in
Go</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>So many times when I tried to learn a concept I would find blog posts
with only partial code. The post would link to a GitHub repo that, by
the time I got to the post, had evolved significantly beyond what was
described in the post. The repo code had by then become too complex
for me to follow. So I was motivated to write minimal implementations
and walk through the code in its entirety.</p>
<div class="note">
  Even today there is not a single post on implementing TCP/IP from
  scratch that walks through entirely working code. (Please, someone
  write this.)
</div><p>I have also had a blast writing survey posts such as <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-09-21-how-do-databases-execute-expressions.html">how various
databases execute
expressions</a>,
<a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/javascript-implementations.html">analyzing non-V8 JavaScript
implementations</a>,
<a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/parser-generators-vs-handwritten-parsers-survey-2021.html">how various programming language implementations parse
code</a>,
and <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/whats-the-big-deal-about-key-value-databases.html">how various database systems build on top of key-value
databases</a>.</p>
<p>The last two posts have even each been cited in a research paper
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08235">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc23-kaufman.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<h3 id="editing">Editing</h3><p>In terms of quality, my single greatest trick is to read the post out
loud. Multiple times. Notice parts that are awkward or unclear and
rewrite them.</p>
<p>My second greatest trick is to ask friends for review. Some posts like
<a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-02-08-an-intuition-for-distributed-consensus-in-oltp-systems.html">an intuition for distributed
consensus</a>
and <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-07-01-a-write-ahead-log-is-not-a-universal-part-of-durability.html">a write-ahead log is not a universal part of
durability</a>
would simply not have been correct or credible without my fantastic
reviewers. And I'm proud to have <a href="https://eatonphil.com/editor.html">played that
part</a> a few times in turn.</p>
<p>We also have a fantastic #writing-and-drafts channel on the <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Software
Internals Discord</a> where folks
(myself occasionally included) come for post review.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3><p>I've lost count of the total number of times that these posts have
been on the front page of Hacker News or that a tweet announcing a
post has reached triple digits likes. I think I've had 9 posts on the
front of HN this year. I do know that my single best year for HN was
12 months between 2022-2023 where 20 of my posts or projects were on
the front page.</p>
<p>Every time a post does well there's a part of me that worries that
I've peaked. But the way to deal with this has been to ignore that
little voice and to just keep learning new things. I haven't stopped
finding things confusing yet, and <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-06-14-confusion-is-a-muse.html">confusion is a phenomenal
muse</a>.</p>
<p>And also to, like, go out and meet friends for dinner,
<a href="https://nycsystems.xyz/">run</a>
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html">meetups</a>, run <a href="https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html">book clubs</a>,
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/chat.html">chat</a> with you fascinating internet
strangers, play volleyball, and so on.</p>
<p>It's always been about <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-08-24-obsession.html">cultivating healthy
obsessions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="benediction">Benediction</h3><p>In parting, I'll remind you:</p>
