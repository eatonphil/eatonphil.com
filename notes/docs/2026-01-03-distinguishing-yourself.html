  Sometimes I get asked questions that would be more fun to answer in
  public. All letters are treated as anonymous unless permission is
  otherwise granted.
</p><p>Hello [Redacted]! You asked about a friend's son who is a recent
graduate looking for work as a software developer and having a hard
time.</p>
<p>I like to think of three key aspects of getting a job: 1) knowing
where to apply, 2) getting an interview at all, and 3) passing the
interview.</p>
<h3 id="knowing-where-to-apply">Knowing where to apply</h3><p>There are three different types of companies I think about: 1) local
(non-VC backed, non-finance) and public non-tech companies, 2)
VC-backed startups and public tech companies, and 3) Big Tech and
finance companies.</p>
<p>Category 3 companies pay the most (guesstimating the top 95th
percentile) and receive the most applications. Everyone wants those
jobs. They are surprisingly egalitarian about interviewing qualified
applicants. They have the means and need to interview a large number
of people. However, the interviews are very difficult to pass.</p>
<p>Category 2 companies pay very well (guesstimating the top 80th
percentile). They get fewer applicants than Category 3 companies. The
interviews are not horribly difficult but it is hard to distinguish
yourself. There is not always as much capacity to interview every
qualified applicant.</p>
<p>Category 1 companies pay at the 50th percentile. They get very few
qualified applicants. It is not difficult to distinguish yourself.</p>
<p>Category 3 companies are where Computer Science departments attempt to
funnel their students to as they graduate. A portion of them will get
in.</p>
<p>I think of Category 1 and Category 2 companies each making up 45% of
all jobs while Category 3 companies make up the remaining 10% of
jobs. Maybe that's wrong.</p>
<h4 id="my-path">My path</h4><p>My career started with Category 1 companies that I found via
Craigslist or Built In (NYC) or the monthly Hacker News Who's Hiring
thread. The interview lasted a few hours at most and involved fairly
trivial demonstrations of knowledge or me sharing code snippets.</p>
<p>The local company aspect of Category 1 seems seriously
undervalued. How many web or application development companies are in
your nearest small- or medium-sized city? I started interning for
these types of companies in high school. And these were a repeat
source of fallback contract work in my early years when I was in a
pinch.</p>
<p>I eventually moved on to Category 2 companies and that's where I'm
most comfortable. I used to learn about them through the Hacker News
Who's Hiring thread. There are a few levels of interviews but they
aren't incredibly intense. You don't particularly need to do Leetcode
to pass them. These days I prefer to track interesting companies on my
own by observing what companies talk about in their blog and Twitter
and who they employ.</p>
<p>I never had the patience to stick with the long interviews at Category
3 companies, nor the stamina to keep up Leetcode, but I understand
that some people work for FANG companies. Hedge funds (a component of
Category 3 companies) don't seem to accept people without a college
degree unless they are truly exceptional (and I am not) so I never
bothered with those either.</p>
<h4 id="starting-somewhere">Starting somewhere</h4><p>You want to be a software developer. But tech companies are also
always looking for qualified technical support and QA. For many people
it is (well for me it was anyway) most important early on to just have
an income. And once you're there you can be pickier and think longer
term. I consistently see companies move technical support and QA
employees into development roles after a year or few years with the
company. This path seems underrated. Or at least something to consider.</p>
<h3 id="getting-an-interview-at-all">Getting an interview at all</h3><p>Early in your career getting an interview is more of a numbers
game. In Category 1 companies if you can show basic competence (such
as an actually-used Github or code snippets if you're self-taught, or
a Computer Science degree) you will likely get an interview. In
Category 2 companies you will need to deal in more volume. Category 3
companies oddly enough seem a bit more egalitarian about interviewing
everyone. It's quite a slog though. So you need to be prepared for the
process at a single company to take months, if you keep passing rounds
(which require significant preparation themselves).</p>
<p>In general I would estimate that even an experienced and competent
developer should prepare for an average worst-case of 6-12 months to
find a new job.</p>
<p>So again in Category 1 companies it's just a matter of being competent
and in Category 3 companies everyone gets an interview. The only
companies you need to stand out in are the Category 2 companies. So
let's talk about things that might stick out.</p>
<h4 id="you-write-blog-posts">You write blog posts</h4><p>I think writing is best done for the sake of the act itself (it helps
you build confidence about concepts, and helps you develop your
communication skills). In a conversation about interviews, I have to
say it's not very common in my experience to write even a popular blog
post and get asked to interview.</p>
<p>However, once you start writing about niche concepts (for example, how
Postgres development works) you may start getting invited to interview
more often. But I think that's relatively rare and usually only
happens to people who are already in the industry for a while.</p>
<p>But having an active blog certainly shows that you're passionate. When
there are a bunch of competent candidates and one has an active blog,
that might stand out.</p>
<h4 id="you-did-some-side-projects">You did some side projects</h4><p>Doing side projects definitely helps build your skill. And I think it
goes in a similar category as writing where it's a great thing to do
for its own sake. I don't think it happens very often that you do your
own side projects and get asked to interview because of them.</p>
<p>However, just like writing, having side projects might be a
differentiator between otherwise similarly competent developers
because it demonstrates your passion.</p>
<h4 id="you-contribute-to-oss">You contribute to OSS</h4><p>If it is a major OSS that the industry largely uses such as Linux,
Postgres, Kubernetes, LLVM, etc. I think you can stand out if your
contributions are consistent, even if they are not large. If they are
too small, for example small docs changes, to one or even a few
projects I don't think this is going to make a big difference as a
differentiator nor a reason for companies to invite you to interview.</p>
<p>Behind almost every open-source project is one or more
vendors who really want developers who know how the project works. And
if you have a pattern of contributing to some open-source project it
is likely that you will get invited to interview at one of the vendors
who rely on or sell support for it.</p>
<p>But because it's a matter of there being a pattern this is something
that you'd have to be doing for on the order of years before a company
notices.</p>
<h4 id="you-run-a-community">You run a community</h4><p>If you run a book club or meetup group, I think this is a pretty
decent way to stand out because it shows organization skills, which is
an important component of leadership in general. But like with OSS
contributions it is more meaningful if you can show the pattern of
organizing over the years.</p>
<h4 id="you-participate-in-a-community">You participate in a community</h4><p>I think this is a decent way to stand out because showing up
consistently in a community is a way to demonstrate your passion. It's
not a good idea to go to any single event and hope to get hired from
it. It's a chance for you to build relationships that may help you in
the long-term. It's best to build relationships when you need nothing
from them.</p>
<h4 id="you-read-books,-watch-lectures,-get-a-certificate">You read books, watch lectures, get a certificate</h4><p>I don't think this helps you stand out very much. It's too difficult
to really understand what this means or what you got out of it. I
think everyone should read for its own sake. And it may help you build
your own confidence, which is great. But I don't think it's going to
make a difference between similarly competent candidates.</p>
<h4 id="you-acquire-a-master's-degree">You acquire a Master's degree</h4><p>I don't particularly think this helps you stand out. But it does give
you more time to hunt for internships. More industry experience
usually helps the entire process of staying in industry.</p>
<h3 id="passing-an-interview">Passing an interview</h3><p>I don't really have anything to add here beyond the numerous books and
apps that help you study common interview questions and patterns.</p>
<p>That said, the way I preferred to prepare for interviews was not
through the interview books or apps but to always be coding and always
be building my confidence in all aspects of the technology stack. Do
whatever you like.</p>
<h3 id="recapping">Recapping</h3><p>It helps your job prospects over the years to be building
relationships with the community in general. And there are different
tiers of companies to think about and different positions to consider
in the short-term as you're getting started. It is usually easier to
transfer to a different job within a company rather than interview and
get that new job while also switching companies.</p>
<p>There are a lot of activities including side projects and writing that
can immediately start to build your confidence. It's important to be
knowledgeable and confident once you do get interviews. Some of these
activities may distinguish you in small ways immediately. But more so
there are many things that you can start doing consistently in the
meantime to become more hireable over the years.</p>
<p>This response is generalizations based on my experience. You will find
exceptions to everything I said but hopefully the generalizations are
still broadly useful.</p>
<p>Good luck to your friend's son!</p>
<p>Phil</p>
