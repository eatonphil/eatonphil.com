          <p>Over the years, I have repeatedly felt like I missed the timing for a
meetup or an IRC group or social media in general. I'd go to a meetup
every so often but I'd never make a meaningful connection with people,
whereas everyone else knew each other. I'd join an IRC group and have
difficulty catching up with what seemed to be the flow of
conversation.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought much about this until the pandemic when I started a
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord group for software
internals</a> and a virtual tech talk
series called Hacker Nights. Since 2021 the Discord reached around
1,500 members and ~20 fairly active members. And the Meetup peaked at
about 300 members with about 10-20 showing up each Meetup.</p>
<p>After the pandemic receded I started an <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-ddia.html">NYC-based book
club</a> over 2 months with about
5-8 active attendees. I ran a <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-10-wehack-postgres.html">virtual hack week on
Discord</a> where I
got ~100 devs into a temporary Discord server and we talked about
Postgres internals and shared resources. Ultimately around 5 of us wrote blog
posts and built new projects to explore Postgres.</p>
<p>I started a <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-database-internals.html">virtual, async email book
club</a> (that is
still ongoing) with 300 devs from November 2023 to Feb 2024. There
have been around 20 active members of the club. And each week the
discussion is kicked off by one of the members, not myself.</p>
<p>And I felt like there wasn't enough community opportunity for folks in
systems programming in NYC so I started an <a href="https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html">Manhattan-based Systems
Coffee
Club</a>. Around 15
people showed up to the first meeting and seemed even more excited
about it than I was. (And I was excited!)  We'll see where it goes
from here.</p>
<p>Organizing people to do this stuff doesn't come easy to me. I enjoy
doing it to a degree, but every night before an event I have trouble
sleeping. Worried about embarrassing myself. When the event happens
though, and people are happy to be there to chat with everyone else,
as they invariably have been, it makes it worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="everyone-want-community">Everyone want community</h3><p>Something I realized along the way is that people (maybe devs
especially, I don't know) are looking for community. And when I have
noticed there seems to be a missing flashpoint (a topic, a career
focus, a book, etc.) for community, it's been pretty easy to get
people together around it.</p>
<h3 id="the-lifecycle-of-groups">The lifecycle of groups</h3><p>Groups, meetups, naturally live and die. Organizers get burnt out. I
don't see this as a problem. It's just the way it is.</p>
<p>At some point I'll get burnt out too. Or I'll get pickier. For
example, I've been avoiding starting a systems programming meetup in
NYC because I know it will be a big effort. So I've done lower effort
groups like book clubs and coffee clubs.</p>
<p>Don't worry about signing yourself up for indefinite work. Just do
whatever you'd like to and don't feel bad if you have to stop. Someone
else will eventually start the next great group, even if it comes in a
different medium or flavor.</p>
<h3 id="community-is-contagious">Community is contagious</h3><p>There are great communities out there that have inspired me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aleksey Charapko's and Murat Demirbas's virtual
<a href="https://charap.co/reading-group/">Distributed Systems Reading Group</a></li>
<li>Alex Petrov's <a href="https://twitter.com/ifesdjeen">database paper reading group</a></li>
<li>Andy Pavlo's <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminar2023/">database interview series</a></li>
<li>Paul Butler's <a href="https://browsertech.com/nyc">BrowserTech meetup</a></li>
<li>Eric Zhang's <a href="https://twitter.com/ekzhang1/status/1700993939841716254">New York Systems Reading Group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And this year I've been hearing about more.</p>
<ul>
<li>TU Munich students <a href="https://www.tumuchdata.club/">started a Student Database Group</a></li>
<li>A group of developers <a href="https://twitter.com/Keleesssss/status/1720466270032691460">starting a Türkiye-language CS reading group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are yet a few more systems programming groups I've heard rumors
about being started on the US West Coast and Stockholm.</p>
<h3 id="do-whatever-you-want!">Do whatever you want!</h3><p>If you feel like you can't find the right group or that you don't fit
in with existing groups or that you're missing a moment, there are
surely other folks in the same boat. Waiting for a new group to
join. You may be the catalyst.</p>
<p>There's enormous potential for getting people together and doing
something interesting and there isn't necessarily anyone telling you
you should. Things you try may work and they may not. The more you try
the more you'll learn what works and what doesn't. I've had a few
years of <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/eight-years-of-tech-meetups.html">making mistakes
organizing</a>
to hone the sense.</p>
<p>The only boring thing to do is to necessarily limit yourself to the
sort of thing others have done before! Run a browser meetup instead of
a React meetup. Interview hardware developers to teach software
developers something. Get software developers with 20 years of
experience in niche fields to teach the rest of us something. Read
books beyond SICP or Clean Code. Try difficult programming projects.</p>
<p>Whatever you want though, don't let me deter you. If you think
something should exist, give it a shot!</p>
