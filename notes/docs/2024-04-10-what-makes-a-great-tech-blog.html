          <p>I want to explain why the blogs in <a href="https://lists.eatonphil.com/blogs.html">My favorite technical
blogs</a> are my favorite. That
page is solely about non-corporate tech blogs. So this post is
too. I'll have to make another list for favorite corporate tech blogs.</p>
<p>In short, they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tackle hard and confusing topics</li>
<li>Show working code</li>
<li>Make things simpler</li>
<li>Write regularly</li>
<li>Talk about tradeoffs and downsides</li>
<li>Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tackle-hard-and-confusing-topics">Tackle hard and confusing topics</h3><p>There are a number of problems in programming and computer science
where otherwise knowledgeable programmers have to start mumbling
about, or revert to cliches or group-think, because they aren't
sure.</p>
<p>These are the best topics you can possibly dive deep into. And my
favorite writers do exactly this.</p>
<p>They write about durability guarantees of disks and filesystems. They
write about common pitfalls in benchmarking. They write about database
consistency anomalies. They write about threading and IO models.</p>
<p>And they write about it by showing concrete examples and concrete logic
so you can learn how to stop handwaving on the topic.</p>
<p>Their writing helps you come out with a useful mental model you can
apply to your own problems.</p>
<p>And you know, sometimes it's not about the topic being
obscure. Good writers have the ability to tackle a boring topic in an
interesting light. Maybe by digging deeper into a root cause. Or
showing you the history behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Moreover, my favorite writers don't know everything. But they also
don't pretend to know everything. They're quick to admit they don't
understand something and ask for help from their readers.</p>
<h3 id="show-working-code">Show working code</h3><p>I love to see complete working code in a post. In contrast there are
many projects that start out simple and people write an article that
covers the project at a high level. But they keep working on the
project and it becomes more complex.</p>
<p>It's not always easy to follow commits over time.</p>
<p>Eli Bendersky and Serge Zaitsev are particularly great at developing
small but meaningful projects in a single post or short series.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if people only did this, we wouldn't hear about the
development of long-running projects like V8 or Postgres. So I guess
this style has limits. And I don't penalize people talking about
long-running projects for not showing working code.</p>
<h3 id="make-things-simpler">Make things simpler</h3><p>One of the marks of a good writer is that you can make complex
topics simple. And not just by being reductive. Though sometimes even
being reductive is useful for education.</p>
<p>In contrast I sometimes see articles by less experienced writers and I
marvel how they make a simple topic so complex. I recognize this
because I was <em>absolutely</em> like that 10 years ago, if not 5 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="write-regularly">Write regularly</h3><p>My favorite blogs typically get a new post at least once a month. Some
people, like Murat, write once a week.</p>
<p>I think the practice probably does improve your writing but mostly
it's that they keep my attention by publishing regularly!</p>
<h3 id="talk-about-tradeoffs-and-downsides">Talk about tradeoffs and downsides</h3><p>Nothing builds trust like talking about the issues with something you
built. No project is perfect. And to ignore the downsides risks
seeming like you don't know or understand them.</p>
<p>So the writers I like the most talk about decisions in context. They
talk about the good and the bad.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-internet-slang,-memes,-swearing,-sarcasm,-and-ranting">Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting</h3><p>There's no way I can think of talking about this without sounding
super lame.</p>
<p>One thing I've noticed, particularly among younger colleagues, is the
use of memes or swearing or using 4chan slang or using sarcasm. I
used to write like this 10 years ago too.</p>
<p>There is a chunk of your audience who won't care. The problem is that
there's also a chunk of your (potential) audience who definitely does
care. There's even a chunk of your audience who may not care but just
won't understand (i.e. non-native English speakers).</p>
<p>I have friends and folks I respect who write very well. But that also
are also overly, unnecessarily edgy when they write. I don't like
sharing these posts because I don't want to unnecessarily offend or
turn off people either.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3><p>It would be boring if everyone wrote the same way. I'm glad the
internet is fun and weird. But I wanted to share a few things
that go into my favorite technical blogs that I'm always happy to
refer people to.</p>
