          <p>Let's assume you're familiar with basic SQL databases like PostgreSQL
and MySQL, and document databases like MongoDB and Elasticsearch. You
probably know Redis too.</p>
<p>But you're hearing more and more about embedded key-value stores like
<a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble">PebbleDB</a>, and so on. And
you're hearing about distributed key-value databases like
<a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a> and
<a href="https://tikv.org/">TiKV</a>.</p>
<p>What's the big deal? Aren't these just the equivalent of Redis or
Java's ConcurrentHashMap?</p>
<p>Let's take a look.</p>
<h3 id="extensible-databases">Extensible databases</h3><p>Over the last 10 years or so (at least), databases have become more
extensible. MySQL has around <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/storage-engines.html">10 different open-source storage
engines</a>. More
surely exist in the wild.</p>
<p>Mongo supports <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/storage-engines/">multiple storage
engines</a>. Relatively
late, PostgreSQL version 12 added support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tableam.html">pluggable storage
engines</a>.</p>
<p class="note">
  <a href="https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb">OrioleDB</a>
  and <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2021/03/06/citus-10-columnar-compression-for-postgres/">Citus
  10's columnar compression</a> are two particularly interesting
  databases making use of PostgreSQL's pluggable storage engine. But
  since neither use an embedded key-value store, I won't talk about
  them more in this post.
</p><p>And so on.</p>
<h4 id="but-why?">But why?</h4><p>Swapping out storage engines allows you to tune the performance of
your database. It can allow you to swap out row-oriented storage for
column-oriented storage (useful for analytics workloads).</p>
<p>It can allow you to swap B-Trees (traditional choice) for <a href="http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/">LSM
Trees</a>
(new hotness) as the underlying storage method (useful for optimizing
write-heavy workloads).</p>
<p>And since some storage engines themselves are built on distributed
consensus (like <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb">FoundationDB</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>), it may even allow you to
turn a non-distributed database into a distributed database.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-sql-to-key-value-storage">Mapping SQL to key-value storage</h3><p>But how the heck do you turn SQL, row-oriented data, into key-value
data?</p>
<p>CockroachDB is a SQL database built on <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/pebble-rocksdb-kv-store/">RocksDB originally and now
their own LevelDB-inspired
database</a>
called <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble">PebbleDB</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I mention that here is because they maintain a great doc
about <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/tech-notes/encoding.md">their method of encoding rows to key-value
form</a>.</p>
<p>To simplify that doc though you can imagine mapping each row
to a key-value form like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">TABLE_IDENTIFIER</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="nx">_$</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">PRIMARY_KEY</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="nx">_$</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">ROW_IDENTIFIER</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">ENCODED_VALUE</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Embedded key-value stores almost always support efficient scanning of
rows by a key-prefix. This means that you can efficiently grab all rows
within a table by prefix-scanning on the table identifier. If you also
include a primary key value along with the table identifier prefix,
you get efficient primary key lookup.</p>
<p>Even though the key space is flat.</p>
<p>For the encoded value you can pick any encoding scheme; as
inefficient as JSON or as efficient as some binary scheme like
Protocol Buffers or Parquet.</p>
<p class="note">
  Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/justinjaffray">Justin Jaffray</a> for
  pointing me at the CockroachDB doc and confirming some of my thoughts
  on encoding strategies.
</p><h4 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h4><p>I've written a couple of tutorials on building a database. They build on
top of embedded key-value stores. If you're interested in seeing
minimal code walkthroughs of how this process can work, check these
posts out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/distributed-postgres.html">Let's build a distributed Postgres proof of concept</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/documentdb.html">Writing a document database from scratch in Go: Lucene-like filters and indexes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="major-aspects-of-key-value-stores">Major aspects of key-value stores</h3><p>Now that you understand how a database can map to a key-value store,
let's take a look at the particular properties that distinguish all
these key-value stores from systems like Redis and Memcached.</p>
<h4 id="reliable-storage">Reliable storage</h4><p>Maybe the single most important thing a storage system does is actual
store data reliably. You can't just <code>open()</code> and <code>write()</code>. To quote
Dan Luu, <a href="https://danluu.com/file-consistency/">files are
hard</a>.</p>
<p>Deferring storage correctness to a dedicated system means database
developers can worry about other aspects of database development.</p>
<h4 id="embeddable">Embeddable</h4><p>Along with reliable storage is the fact that the storage needs to run
in process. Redis, for example, is not embeddable. There are many
other things on top of the storage that need to happen in a high-level
database and RPC calls between processes for storage is an unnecessary
overhead.</p>
<h4 id="efficient-prefix-scans">Efficient prefix scans</h4><p>As mentioned above, support for scans is pretty important for how
indexes and namespaces (tables in SQL) get mapped to key-value
queries.</p>
<p>You shouldn't need to look through all table rows in the flat key space to
find the rows for one table.</p>
<h4 id="additional-aspects">Additional aspects</h4><p>The above isn't a complete list. Different stores provide different
useful aspects like improved performance on certain workloads/in
certain environments, builtin transactions, and so on.</p>
<p>And sometimes it's helpful just to have an embedded store in your
language rather than going through a foreign-function interface.</p>
<h3 id="survey-of-databases-built-on-embedded-key-value-stores">Survey of databases built on embedded key-value stores</h3><p>Lastly, let's take a look at a few databases that build on top of
embedded key-value stores.</p>
<p>Note that some of them are not the primary version of the database
(e.g. MyRocks vs MySQL, MongoRocks vs Mongo). Some of them are the
primary version (e.g. CockroachDB, YugabyteDB).</p>

<h4 id="separately,-distributed-key-value-stores">Separately, distributed key-value stores</h4><p>There is a different kind of key-value store that is a standalone app
designed for distributed data. This list includes
<a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>,
<a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/learning/why/">etcd</a>, likely
<a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a>, and likely
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/06/core-data/zippydb/">ZippyDB</a>. (There's
a nice comparison table about some of these databases on the etcd
page).</p>
<p>These systems are designed to be used sort of like Redis except for
that they are persistant and reliable stores. They are designed to
always be up and always correct. For that reason they form the data
storage backbone of core infrastructure like Kubernetes.</p>
<p>It is possibly how <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/how-foundationdb-powers-snowflake-metadata-forward/">Snowflake uses
FoundationDB</a>
but I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>TiKV is not an embedded key-value database but it's not being used the
same way etcd/Consul are as far as I can tell. It forms the backbone
of <a href="https://en.pingcap.com/">TiDB</a>, an HTAP (hybrid OLAP/OLTP) SQL
database.</p>
<p>Maybe FoundationDB and TiKV deserve their own new category.</p>
<p>But in general these databases have an RPC API that you communicate
with over TCP. They are not generally embedded. You manage their
process(es) separately.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>So in this post we saw that databases are extensible. Storage engines
are often swappable. Dedicated embedded key-value stores allow
database developers to hand off data storage to a dedicated
library. Different key-value stores have different performance
characteristics that help developers and operators tune a database for
their workload.</p>
<p>Embedded key-value stores are a great foundation for all kinds of
databases; SQL databases like CockroachDB, document databases like
Mongo, wide-store databases like Cassandra, and caching databases like
ZippyDB or Redis Enterprise Flash.</p>
<p>This is a complex topic with many, many variations of
systems. Hopefully this was a useful introduction.</p>
<p>Overall if you're not a database developer and you're not running
databases at a massive scale, you can probably ignore the details of
the storage layer.</p>
<p>Did I get something wrong? Or miss something important? Let me
know. :)</p>
