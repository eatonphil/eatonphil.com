          <p>Among the 50 books I read in 2025, I recommend the following 11
non-fiction and 7 fiction works (complete list on Goodreads
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2025">here</a>. These were
the 18 books that I rated a four or five out of five stars.</p>
<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h3><h4 id="on-writing-well-by-william-zinsser">On Writing Well by William Zinsser</h4><p>This is the third or fourth time I've read this book and it has stood
the test of time. It's been a few years since I last read it so it was
a good reminder that a lot of the things I believe and tell people
about writing actually just came from this book. The last 25% is a bit
of a slog but nonetheless it remains one of the single books I think
every professional should read. 5/5</p>
<h4 id="i.-asimov-by-isaac-asimov">I. Asimov by Isaac Asimov</h4><p>I really like reading about how writers make their living. I've also
been a modest fan of Asimov's works (I've loved what I've read I just
haven't read that much). I also love to hear stories of
first-generation immigrants to the US and also he lived in New York
his whole life so it was quite enjoyable. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="hollywood-by-jeanine-basinger-and-sam-wasson">Hollywood by Jeanine Basinger and Sam Wasson</h4><p>This was 100 years of the evolution of the film industry told
basically entirely in disparate interviews edited together. 5/5</p>
<h4 id="the-chief-by-david-nasaw">The Chief by David Nasaw</h4><p>I love the history and business of newspapers and media. Moreover it's
the guy that Citizen Kane was based on. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="brazil-by-lilia-moritz-schwarcz-and-heloisa-murgel-starling">Brazil by Lilia Moritz Schwarcz and Heloisa Murgel Starling</h4><p>I have never learned about the history of Brazil and I found this
introduction enjoyable. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="the-silk-roads-by-peter-frankopan">The Silk Roads by Peter Frankopan</h4><p>I loved the retelling of human history focused on Persia (and later
Iran). 4/5</p>
<h4 id="louis-d.-brandeis-by-melvin-i.-urofsky">Louis D. Brandeis by Melvin I. Urofsky</h4><p>I have never read about a supreme court justice before. This was a
well-written biography and introduction to the history of law and law
education. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="personal-history-by-katharine-graham">Personal History by Katharine Graham</h4><p>Once again I love reading about newspapers and media and the business
and history. This was told by the publisher of The Washington
Post. 5/5</p>
<h4 id="the-snowball-by-alice-schroeder">The Snowball by Alice Schroeder</h4><p>I've had this book about Warren Buffett on my shelf for nearly 10
years and finally went through it this year. A delightful and easy
read despite the bulk. I only am unhappy that it focused more on
family drama than on business decisions. Par for the course with
biographies unfortunately. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="the-cartiers-by-francesca-cartier-brickell">The Cartiers by Francesca Cartier Brickell</h4><p>This story spanned three or four major wars and a couple of
continents. I didn't think I'd be interested in the history of luxury
businesses but it has a lot in common with certain modern industries
in tech too. You put premiums on relationships and building good faith
and so on. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="secret-formula-by-frederick-allen">Secret Formula by Frederick Allen</h4><p>A history of Coca-Cola over the last 100 years or so. Lessons on how
they dealt with competition (Pepsi and Keurig Dr. Pepper) and product
revitalization (New Coke, Diet Coke, etc.). Quite an interesting
read. 5/5</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction</h3><h4 id="the-buffalo-hunter-hunter-by-stephen-graham-jones">The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones</h4><p>I got into horror fiction last year (not so much slashers but more
just one of the better written categories of genre fiction). This book
was one of my two favorite novels of the year.</p>
<p>It's a fictional retelling of American history where a Native American
becomes a vampire and takes revenge on American colonizers in the
American West. 5/5</p>
<h4 id="the-handmaid's-tale-by-margaret-atwood">The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood</h4><p>This was my other favorite novel of the year. I am embarrassed not to
have read it before. It's a dystopian story about the USA if all women
were required to give birth to deal with a fertility crisis. 5/5</p>
<h4 id="the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue-by-v.e.-schwab">The Invisible Life of Addie Larue by V.E. Schwab</h4><p>A French woman gets to live forever but everyone she meets forgets her
after leaving her presence. An easy and enjoyable read. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="vampires-of-el-norte-by-isabel-cañas">Vampires of El Norte by Isabel Cañas</h4><p>I love a good vampire story, and I love fictional retellings using
fantastical horror elements to emphasize atrocities. Vampires employed
by the US military help the US in the 1840s take Texas from
Mexico. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="the-very-secret-society-of-irregular-witches-by-sangu-mandanna">The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches by Sangu Mandanna</h4><p>This was a cute cozy mystery about British witches forced to hide from
society, learning how to accept themselves and develop trust in their
community. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="pride-and-prejudice-by-jane-austen">Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</h4><p>I am likewise embarrassed I have not read this before, nor anything
else by Austen. I'm told I haven't rated it highly enough. I will
undoubtedly reread it. I loved the wit. It required closer reading
than I expected. 4/5</p>
<h4 id="james-by-percival-everett">James by Percival Everett</h4><p>This was a retelling of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as told by the
slave, Jim. If you saw the movie American Fiction a few years ago,
it's the same author (of the original book). Everett has very
interesting ideas and I look forward to reading more by him. 4/5</p>
