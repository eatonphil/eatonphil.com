          <p>The last time I read for fun was in elementary school. Since college I
knew I must read more, but I never forced myself to build the
habit. Then three years ago I spent time around my brother and a
coworker who were avid readers. This "peer pressure" helped me get
started.</p>
<p>Since I started, I've seen concrete improvements in vocabulary. I find
myself using words I didn't know I knew. I question my choice of words
more. And I understand coworkers a little better. Perhaps it is only
personal style, but I've also become more aware of hyperbole in my
speech and have begun to tone that down.</p>
<p>Specifically, books provide more density of information than I can
pull together myself. I've also benefited heavily from reading books
on tools I use daily. Contrary to being boring, a book on a topic with
which I'm familiar has been a (often needed) break from books on
topics with which I am unfamiliar. The former category might include
books on CSS, Bash, Emacs, Python, Scheme, data modeling,
Linux/FreeBSD system administration, mystery novels, and so on. The
latter category might include books on Common Lisp, system
architecture, the implementation of Linux/FreeBSD, behavioral
psychology, management, stock/bond markets, the history of
Argentina/Chile/South Korea/Japan, sci-fi novels, and so on.</p>
<p>Reading diversely exposes how little I know. And that can be
depressing. But I'm fairly confident reading books is the fastest way
to grow.</p>
<p>Tactically speaking, I started slowly with few books and the ones
easiest for me to read. The first year I read two books, both
technical. The second year I read nine books and was able to start
branching out beyond technical books. Last year I read a much more
diverse set of forty books. And this year I followed suit with
forty-one so far (on track for fifty-five or so).</p>
<p>I keep track of books I'm reading and books I want to read in
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/eatonphil">Goodreads</a>. I particularly enjoy
their reading challenge system that lets you know if you are on track
to meet your reading goal for the year.</p>
