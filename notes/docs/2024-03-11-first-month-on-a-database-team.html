          <p><!-- -*- mode: markdown -*- --></p>
<p>A little over a month ago, I joined EnterpriseDB on a
distributed Postgres product
(<a href="https://enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd">PGD</a>). The process of onboarding
myself has been pretty similar at each company in the last decade,
though I think I've gotten better at it. The process is of course
influenced by the team, and my coworkers have been excellent. Still, I
wanted to share my thought process and personal strategies.</p>
<h3 id="avoid,-at-first,-what-is-always-challenging">Avoid, at first, what is always challenging</h3><p>Trickier things at companies are the people, organization, and
processes. What code exists? How does it work together? Who owns what?
How can I find easy code issues to tackle? How do I know what's
important (so I can avoid picking it up and becoming a bottleneck).</p>
<p>But also, in the first few days or weeks you aren't exactly expected
to contribute meaningfully to features or bugs. Your sprint
contributions are not tracked too closely.</p>
<p>The combination of 1) what to avoid and 2) the sprint-freedom-you-have
leads to a few interesting and valuable areas to work on on your own:
the build process, tests, running the software, and docs.</p>
<p>But code need not be ignored either. Some frequent areas to get your
first code contributions in include user configuration code, error
messages, and stale code comments.</p>
<p>What follows are some little 1st day, 1st week, 1st month projects I
went through to bootstrap my understanding of the system.</p>
<h3 id="build-process">Build process</h3><p>First off, where is the code and how do you build it? This requires
you to have all the relevant dependencies. Much of my work is on a
Postgres extension. This meant having a local Postgres development
environment, having gcc, gmake (on mac), Perl, and so on. And
furthermore, PGD is a pretty mature product so it supports building
against multiple Postgres distributions. Can I build against all of
them?</p>
<p>The easiest situation is when there are instructions for all of this,
linked directly from your main repo. When I started, the instructions
did exist but in a variety of places. So over the first week I started
collecting all of what I had learned about building the system, with
dependencies, across distributions, and with various important flags
(debug mode on, asserts enabled, etc.). I finished the first week by
writing a little internal blog post called "Hacking on PGD".</p>
<p>I hadn't yet figured out the team processes so I didn't want to bother
anyone by trying to get this "blog post" committed anywhere yet as
official internal documentation. Maybe there already was a good doc, I
just hadn't noticed it yet. So I just published it in a private
Confluence page and shared it in the private team slack. If anyone
else benefited from it, great! Otherwise, I knew I'd want to refer
back to it.</p>
<p>This is an important attitude I think. It can be hard to tell what
others will benefit from. If you get into the habit of writing things
down internally for your own sake, but making it available internally,
it is likely others will benefit from it too. This is something I've
learned from years of blogging publicly outside of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, the simple act of writing a good post creates yourself as
something of an authority. This is useful for yourself if no one else.</p>
<h4 id="writing-a-good-post">Writing a good post</h4><p>Let's get distracted here for a second. One of the most important
things I think in documentation is documenting not just what does
exist but what doesn't. If you had to take a path to get something to
work, did you try other paths that didn't work? It can be extremely
useful to figure out what <em>exactly</em> is required for something.</p>
<p>Was there a flag that you tried to build with but you didn't try
building without it? Well try again without it and make sure it was
necessary. Was there some process you executed where the build
succeeded but you can't remember if it was actually necessary for the
build to succeed?</p>
<p>It's difficult to explain why I think this sort of precision is
useful but I'm pretty sure it is. Maybe because it builds the habit of
not treating things as magic when you can avoid it. It builds the
habit of asking questions (if only to yourself) to understand and not
just to get by.</p>
<h4 id="static-analysis?-dynamic-analysis?">Static analysis? Dynamic analysis?</h4><p>Going back to builds, another aspect to consider is static and dynamic
analysis. Are there special steps to using gdb or valgrind or other
analyzers? Are you using them already? Can you get them running
locally? Has any of this been documented?</p>
<p>Maybe the answer to all of those is yes, or maybe none of those are
relevant but there are likely similar tools for your ecosystem. If
analysis tools are relevant and no one has yet explored them, that's
another very useful area to explore as a newcomer.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3><p>After I got the builds working, I felt the obvious next step was to
run tests. But what tests exist?  Are there unit tests? Integration
tests? Anything else? Moreover, is there test coverage? I was certain
I'd be able to find some low-hanging contributions to make if I could
find some files with low test coverage.</p>
<p>Alas, my certainty hit the wall in that there were in fact too many
types of integration tests that all do provide coverage already. They
just don't all <em>report</em> coverage.</p>
<p>The easiest ways to report coverage (with gcov) were only reporting
coverage for certain integration tests that we run locally. There are
more integration tests run in cloud environments and getting coverage
reports there to merge with my local coverage files would have
required more knowledge of people and processes, areas that I wanted
not to be forced to think about too quickly.</p>
<p>So coverage wasn't a good route to go. But around this time, I noticed
a ticket that asked for a simple change to user configuration code. I
was able to make the change pretty quickly and wanted to add tests. We
have our own test framework built on top of Postgres's powerful Perl
test framework. But it was a little difficult to figure out how to use
either of them.</p>
<p>So I copied code from other tests and pared it down until I got the
smallest version of test code I could get. This took maybe a day or
two of tweaking lines and rerunning tests since I didn't understand
everything that was/wasn't required. Also it's Perl and I've never
written Perl before so that took a bit of time and ChatGPT. (Arrays,
man.)</p>
<p>In the end though I was able to collect my learnings into another
internal confluence post just about how to write tests, how to debug
tests, how to do common things within tests (for example, ensuring a
Postgres log line was outputted), etc. I published this post as well
and shared it in the team Slack.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3><p>I had PGD built locally and was able to run integration tests locally,
but I still hadn't gotten a cluster running. Nor played with the
eventual consistency demos I knew we supported. We had a great
quickstart that ran through all the manual steps of getting a two-node
cluster up. This was a distillation, for devs, of a more elaborate
process we give to customers in a production-quality script.</p>
<p>But I was looking for something in between a production-quality
script and manually initializing a local cluster. And I also wanted to
practice my understanding of our test process. So I ported our
quickstart to our integration test framework and made a PR with this
new test, eventually merging this into the repo. And I wrote a minimal
Python script for bringing up a local cluster. I've got an open PR to
add this script to the repo. Maybe I'll learn though that a simple
script such as this does already exist, and that's fine!</p>
<h3 id="docs">Docs</h3><p>The entire time, as I'd been trying to build and test and run PGD, I
was trying to understand our terminology and architecture by going
through our public docs. I had a lot of questions coming out of this
I'd ask in the team channel.</p>
<p>Not to toot my horn but I think it's somewhat of a superpower to be
able/willing to ask "dumb questions" in a group setting. That's how I
frame it anyway. "Dumb question: what does X mean in this paragraph?"
Or, "dumb question: when we say performance improvement because of Y,
what is the intuition here?" Because of the time spent here, I was
able to make a few more docs contributions as I read through the docs
as well.</p>
<p>You have to balance where you ask your dumb questions though. Asking
dumb questions to one person doesn't benefit the team. But asking dumb
questions in too wide a group is sometimes bad politics. Asking "dumb
questions" in front of your team seems to have the best bang for buck.</p>
<p>But maybe the more important contributions were, when I got more
comfortable with the team, proposing to merge my personal, internal
Confluence blog posts into the repo as docs. I think in a number of
cases, what I wrote about indeed hadn't been concisely collected
before and thus was useful to have as team documentation.</p>
<p>Even more challenging was trying to distill (a chunk of) the internal
architecture. Only after following many varied internal docs and
videos, and following through numerous code paths, was I able to
propose an architecture diagram outlining major components and
communication between them, with their differing formats (WAL records,
internal enums, etc.) and means of communication (RPC, shared memory,
etc.). This architecture diagram is still in review and may be totally
off. But it's already helped at least me think about the system.</p>
<p>In most cases this was all information that the team had already
written or explained but just bringing it together and summarizing
provided a different useful perspective I think. Even if none of the
docs got merged it still helped to build my own understanding.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-the-repo">Beyond the repo</h3><p>Learning the project is just one aspect of onboarding. Beyond that I
join the #cats channel, the #dogs channel, found some fellow New
Yorkers and opened a NYC channel, and tried to find Zoom-time with the
various people I'd see hanging around common team Slack
channels. Trying to meet not just devs but support folk, product
managers, marketing folk, sales folk, and anyone else!</p>
<p>Walking the line between scouring our docs and GitHub and Confluence
and Jira on my own, and bugging people with my incessant questions.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed my time at startups. I've been a dev, a manager, a
founder, a cofounder. But I'm incredibly excited to be back, at a
bigger company, full-time as a developer hacking on a database!</p>
<p>And what about you? What do you do to onboard yourself at a new
company or new project?</p>
