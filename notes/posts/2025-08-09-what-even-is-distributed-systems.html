# What even is distributed systems
## August 9, 2025
###### distsys

Distributed systems is simply the study of interactions between
processes. Every two interacting processes form a distributed system,
whether they are on the same host or not. Distributed systems create
new challenges (compared to single-process systems) in terms of
correctness (i.e. *consistency*), reliability, and performance
(i.e. latency and throughput).

The best way to learn about the principles and fundamentals of
distributed systems is to 1\) read Designing Data Intensive
Applications and 2\) read through the papers and follow the notes in
the [MIT Distributed Systems
course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).

For Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA), I strongly encourage
you to find buddies at work or online who will read it through with
you. You can also always join the [Software Internals
Discord](https://eatonphil.com/discord.html)'s \#distsys channel to
ask questions as you go. But it's still best if you have some partners
to go through the book with, even if they are as new to it as you.

I also used to think that you might want to wait a few years into your
career before reading DDIA but when you have friends to read it with I
think you need not wait.

If you have only skimmed the book you should definitely go back and
give it a thorough read. I have read it three times already and I will
read it again as part of the [Software Internals Book
Club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html) next year after the 2nd
Edition is published.

Keep in mind that every chapter of DDIA provides references to papers
you can keep reading should you end up memorizing DDIA itself.

When you've read parts of DDIA or the MIT Distributed Systems course
and you want practice, the Fly.io x Jepsen [Distributed Systems
Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) is one guided option. Other
options might include simply implementing (getting progressively more
complex down the list):

* two-phase commit  
* three-phase commit  
* single-decree Paxos
* highly available key-value store on top of a 3rd-party consensus library
* chain replication (or CRAQ), using a 3rd-party consensus library  
* Raft
* epaxos

And if you get bored there you can see Alex Miller's [Data Replication
Design
Spectrum](https://transactional.blog/blog/2024-data-replication-design-spectrum)
for more ideas and variants.

And if you want more people to follow, check out the [Distributed
Systems section](https://eatonphil.com/blogs.html#Distributedsystems)
of my favorite blogs page.

If these projects and papers sound arcane or intimidating, know that
you will see the problems these projects/papers solve whether or not
you know and understand these solutions. Developers often end up
reinventing hacky versions of these which are more likely to have
subtle bugs.

While instead you can recognize and use one of these well-known
building blocks. Or at least have the background to better reason
about correctness should you be in a situation where you must work
with a novel distributed system or you end up designing a new one
yourself.

And again, if you want folks to bounce ideas off of or ask questions
to, I strongly encourage you to join the Software Internals Discord
and ask there!
