If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, [proggit](https://reddit.com/r/programming) or even
language-specific subreddits like
[/r/python](https://reddit.com/r/python), you're missing out.

What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:
* The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer
* Posts generally go into good depth
* The comments stay on topic
* And the shit-posting is minimal

This list isn't hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it's worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.

* [/r/EmuDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/)
  * My favorite sub of all. Also has a [phenomenal Discord group](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/9mop2q/join_the_official_remudev_chat_on_discord/).
* [/r/ProgrammingLanguages](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminglanguages)
  * Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.
* [/r/DatabaseDevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DatabaseDevelopment/)
  * All about database internals, which ends up involving a bunch of
  correctness and distributed systems stuff as well.
  * Disclosure: I run this sub. It's at 2.7k+ members at time of publishing.
* [/r/ReverseEngineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/)
  * The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.
* [/r/EsoLangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/esolangs/)
  * One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.
* [/r/Compilers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/)
* [/r/GraphicsProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/)

While some language subreddits are pretty good, they are more so a
mixed bag than some of the topic-specific subreddits here. So they
don't make my list, more on principle than anything else.

If there is a good one already, send me it!

### What am I missing?

Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don't say
language-specific ones. :)
