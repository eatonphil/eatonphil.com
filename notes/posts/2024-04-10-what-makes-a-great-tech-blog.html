# What makes a great technical blog

I want to explain why the blogs in [My favorite techical
blogs](https://lists.eatonphil.com/blogs.html) are my favorite. That
page is solely about non-corporate tech blogs. So this post is
too. I'll have to make another list for favorite corporate tech blogs.

In short, they:

* Tackle hard and confusing topics
* Show working code
* Make things simpler
* Write regularly
* Talk about tradeoffs and downsides
* Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting

### Tackle hard and confusing topics

There are a number of problems in programming and computer science
where otherwise knowledgeable programmers have to start mumbling
about, or reverting to cliches or group-think, because they aren't
sure.

These are the best topics you can possibly dive deep into. And my
favorite writers do exactly this.

They write about durability guarantees of disks and filesystems. They
write about common pitfalls in benchmarking. They write about database
consistency anomalies. They write about threading and IO models.

And they write about it by showing concrete examples and concrete logic
so you can learn how to stop handwaving on the topic.

And you know, sometimes it's not about about the topic being
obscure. Good writers have the ability to tackle a boring topic in an
interesting light. Maybe by digging deeper into a root cause. Or
showing you the history behind the scenes.

Their writing helps you come out with a useful mental model you can
apply to your own problems.

### Show working code

I love to see complete working code in a post. In contrast there are
many projects that start out simple and people write an article that
covers the project at a high level. But they keep working on the
project and it becomes more complex.

It's not always easy to follow commits over time.

Eli Bendersky and Serge Zaitsev are particularly great at developing
small but meaningful projects in a single post or short series.

### Make things simpler

One of the marks a good writer is that you can make complex
topics simple. And not just by being reductive. Though sometimes even
being reductive is useful for education.

In contrast I sometimes see articles by less experienced writers and I
marvel how they make a simple topic so complex. I recognize this
because I was *absolutely* like that 10 years ago, if not 5 years ago.

### Write regularly

My favorite blogs typically get a new post at least once a month. Some
people, like Murat, write once a week.

I think the practice probably does improve your writing but mostly
it's that they keep my attention by publishing regularly!

### Talk about tradeoffs and downsides

Nothing builds trust like talking about the issues with something you
built. No project is perfect. And to ignore the downsides risks
seeming like you don't know or understand them.

So the writers I like the most talk about decisions in context. They
talk about the good and the bad.

### Avoid internet slang, memes, swearing, sarcasm, and ranting

There's no way I can think of talking about this without sounding
super lame.

One thing I've noticed particularly among younger colleagues is the
propensity to use memes or swear or use 4chan slang or use sarcasm. I
also used to write like this 10 years ago.

There is a chunk of your audience who won't care. The problem is that
there's also a chunk of your (potential) audience who definitely does
care. There's even a chunk of your audience who may not care but just
won't understand (i.e. non-native English speakers).

I have friends and folks I respect who write very well. But they are
also overly, unnecessarily edgy when they write. I don't like
sharing these posts because I don't want to unnecessarily offend or
turn off people either.

### Random thoughts

It would be boring if everyone wrote the same way. But I wanted to
share a few things that go into my favorite blogs.
