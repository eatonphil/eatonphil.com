# An effective product manager

There are three specific activities I have loved in some product
managers I've worked with (and missed in others).

tldr;

* Talk with customers and prospects
* Develop and share a vision
* Evangelize

### Talk with customers and prospects

As a product manager, your superpower over engineering is to have
spent time with customers and prospects. You should have (or develop)
a good understanding of the market and your product's potential.

The only way you can do this is by spending time, over time, with
customers and prospects. Understanding their workflows and their
issues.

### Develop and share a vision

Cynical folks will cringe at the word "vision" but it is a serious and
necessary part of a successful organization.

As a product manager, you should stablish and share a path for
engineering to follow based on your understanding of customers,
prospects, the market, and the company.

This is the "roadmap" and "prioritization". But prioritization is
useless without a long-term vision.

The roadmap should represent (and broadly demonstrate) a concrete and
meaningful goal. A goal that you can and should adjust over time as
the company and market changes.

### Evangelize

In bigger organizations there might be dedicated evangelism teams. But
product managers must drive this work.

Evangelism should fit the vision you've developed.

And in the absense of dedicated evangelism teams, product managers
should be creating demos, writing blog posts, and testing the solution
with customers and prospects.

Again, it's fine for dedicated teams outside of product management to
do bits of that work. But it must be driven and led by the product
manager.

### It's hard

Observed as I have from outside, being an effective product
manager feels like a massively challenging task.

It's so easy to go without talking to customers, to get sucked into
day-to-day issues and not create a vision, and to allow evangelism to
happen ad-hoc.

### My ideas, your ideas

These are my ideas based on my
[experience](https://eatonphil.com/). You may have your own ideas. If
mine help you, great! If they don't, great!
