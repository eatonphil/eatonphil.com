# Thinking about functional programming

Someone on Discord asked about how to learn functional programming.

The question and my initial tweet on the subject prompted an
interesting
[discussion](https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1691548254331092992)
with [Shriram
Krishnamurthi](https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi) and other folks.

So here's a slightly more thought out exploration.

<p class="note">
  I spent a bunch of time a while
  ago <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo">programming in
  Standard ML</a> and I wrote
  a <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/bsdscheme">chunk of a Scheme
  implementation</a> so I have a bit of background.
  <br /> <br />
  But, hey, this is a free opinion.

### Concepts from functional programming

When people talk about functional programming, I think of a few key
choices you can make while programming:

* Immutability by default
* (Tail) recursion by default
* First-class functions (and the suite of tools that go along with it. e.g. map, reduce/fold)

And if you have experience as a programmer, you either get the basic
gist of these tenets or you can easily read about the basics. That is,
while most programmers I've met understood the basics, most
programmers I've met were not particularly *comfortable* or *fluent*
expressing programs with these ideas.

For myself, the only way I got comfortable expressing code with these
ideas was lots of practice (as I mentioned above). And the thing is,
even after I did a bunch of programming in Standard ML and Scheme, I
really don't see a particular benefit to practicing in a language
other than one with which you are already comfortable in general.

So I think it's kind of misguided when person A asks how to learn
functional programmer and person B responds that they should learn
Haskell or OCaml or whatever. I see this happen pretty often online.

<p class="note">
  Beyond any "language for functional programming" as a recommendation
  in general, Haskell is a particularly egregious suggestion to make
  in my opinion because not only are you trying to practice functional
  programming tenets but you're also dealing with a complex type
  system and lazy evaluation.
</p>

Instead, [practice immutability, recursion,
map/reduce](https://notes.eatonphil.com/practicing-recursion.html) in
whatever language you like.

### Programming languages

If you want to study programming languages, that's awesome. However,
functional programming doesn't really have any direct connection to
studying programming languages.

Languages are all over the place. Scheme, Standard ML, and Haskell are
worlds apart, even within the functional programming family.

And modern languages have mostly adapted the aspects of functional
programming that used to be unique 20 years ago.

Moreover, there are many other worthwhile families of languages to
learn about:

* Imperative/C-like (ok, you probably already know these)
* Stack-based (JVM, x86 assembly sort of, Forth)
* Array-oriented (APL, J)
* Declarative (CSS, SQL, TLA+, Prolog)
* Data (HTML, JSON, YAML)
* Proof assistants (Isabelle/HOL, Coq)

The list isn't exhaustive, and the variations within families can be
massive. But the point is that functional programming doesn't mean
crazy programming languages or crazy programming ideas. Functional
programming is a *subset* of crazy programming languages and crazy
programming ideas.

If you want to learn about crazy programming languages and crazy
programming ideas, you should! Go for it!

### Introduction to Computer Science

SICP is famous as the (former) introductory textbook for computer
science at MIT, and for its use of Scheme and the [Metacircular
Evaluator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator).

I don't have any experience teaching beginners how to program so I
don't have thoughts on if this made sense. That's for folks like
[Shriram](https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1691548254331092992)
to think about.

However, I'm a half-decent programmer and I can't make it through this
book. If you liked the book or want to read it, that's great! But I [don't
recommend](https://notes.eatonphil.com/recommending-a-book.html) it to
anyone.

And many introductory Computer Science textbooks just don't make much
sense to give to experienced programmers. For an experienced
programmer, they can be quite slow!

Most of the folks I see asking about how to learn functional
programming are experienced programmers.

### Do whatever you feel like doing

I don't mean to overanalyze things, or get you overanalyzing
things. If you want to learn functional programming by writing
Haskell, that's awesome, you should go for it.

Wanting to do something is basically the best motivation there is.

The only reason I write this sort of post is so that folks who think
that using Haskell or Standard ML or Scheme or reading SICP is the
only way to learn functional programming see those ideas aren't
necessarily true.

### Write a Scheme!

Finally, for folks with time and motivation wanting to seriously work
out their functional programming muscles, writing a Scheme
implementation with a decent chunk of the standard library can be an
immensely enjoyable project.

You'll learn a lot about languages and compilers and algorithms and
data structures. It's leetcode with meaning.
