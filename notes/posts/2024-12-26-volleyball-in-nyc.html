# Picking up volleyball in NYC with Goodrec and New York Urban

It is easy to start playing beginner volleyball in New York. The two
platforms I've used to find volleyball games are
[Goodrec](https://www.goodrec.com/) and [New York
Urban](https://www.nyurban.com/).

While these platforms may also offer classes and leagues, I mostly use
them to play "pickup" games. Pickup games are where you show up and
join (or get assigned to) a team to play for an hour or two. Easy to
go on your own or with friends.

I was super intimidated to go on my own at first, but the people are
in fact so friendly and welcoming that it has been easy to keep
playing consistently every week the last 5 months since I started.

### Goodrec

With Goodrec you have to use their mobile app. Beginner tier is called
"social" on Goodrec. So browse available games until you find one at
the level you want to play. You enroll in (buy a place in) sessions
individually.

Sessions are between 90-120 minutes long.

They ask you not to arrive more than 10 minutes early at the gym. When
you arrive you tell the gym managers (usually in a desk up front
somewhere) you're there for Goodrec and the tier (in case the gym has
multiple level games going on at the same time). Then you wait until
the Goodrec "host" arrives and they will organize the people into
teams.

Goodrec hosts are players who volunteer to organize the games. They'll
explain the rules of the game (makes Goodrec very good for beginners)
and otherwise help you out.

Always say thank you to your host!

### New York Urban

With New York Urban, pickup sessions are called ["open
play"](https://www.nyurban.com/open-play-volleyball).

There is no mobile app, you just use the website to purchase a spot in
a session. The sessions are longer and cheaper than Goodrec. There is
no host. The options are more limited too. You play at one of four
high schools on either a Friday night or on Sunday. And session slots
tend to sell out much more quickly than with Goodrec.

### Big City Volleyball

You can also check out [Big City
Volleyball](https://bigcityvolleyball.com/) but I haven't used it yet.

### Making friends and improving

It was super awkward to go at first! I went by myself. I didn't know
what I was doing. I couldn't remember and didn't know many rules. I
didn't have court shoes or knee pads.

But the Goodrec host system is particularly great for bringing
beginners in and making them feel welcome. You have a great time even
if you're terrible.

The first game I went to I tried to hang out afterward to meet people
but people either came with their SO or with their friends or by
themselves so they all just left immediately or hung out in their
group.

So you can't just go once and expect to make friends immediately. But
if you keep going at the same place and time regularly week over week,
you'll see the familiar faces. About half the people I play with each
week are regulars. If you're friendly you'll start making friends with
these people and eventually start going out to bars with them after
the games.

So even if you find yourself embarrassingly bad at first, just keep
going! I'm 29, 6'1, 190lbs and from observation the past 5 months,
age, height, and weight have a very indirect relation to playing
ability.

I'm hesitant to recommend anything since I'm still such a beginner,
but I've found [Coach
Donny's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEMagRUvrXELuJZwS4DevA)
videos helpful for learning how to serve, set, block, etc.

At first I played 2 hours a week and I was completely exhausted after
the session. Over time it got easier so I started playing 2-3 sessions
a week (6-9-ish hours). With practice and consistency (after about 3-4
months), I started playing Intermediate tier with Goodrec and New York
Urban. And I don't think I'll play Beginner/Social at all anymore.

I still primarily play for fun and for the workout and to meet
people. But it's also fun to get better!

I played with someone much better than myself in an Intermediate
session one time and he mentioned he will probably stop playing
Intermediate and only play High Intermediate. He mentioned you get
better when you keep pushing yourself to play with better and better
players. Good advice!
