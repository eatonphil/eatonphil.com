# Confusion is a muse

Some of the most interesting technical blog posts I read, and a common
formula for posts I write, come from confusion. You're at work and you
start asking questions that are difficult to answer. You spend a few
hours or a day trying to get to the bottom of things.

If you ask a question to very experienced and successful developers at
work, they have a tendency not to give context and to simplify things
down to a single answer. This may be a good way to make business
decisions. (One can't afford to waste an eternity considering
everything indefinitely.) But accepting an answer you don't understand
is actively harmful for building intuition.

In not accepting an answer, you will have to figure out how to do this
in a way that isn't irritating. And for that reason, maybe you can't
do this all the time.

Aside from "go along to get along", another reason we don't pursue
what we're confused about is because we're embarrassed that we're
confused in the first place. What's worse, the embarrassment we feel
naturally grows the more experienced we get. "I've got this title, I
don't want to seem like I don't know what you mean."

But if you fight against the embarrassment and pursue your confusion
regardless, you'll likely figure something interesting out. Moreover,
rarely when I am confused about something was it the case that I was
the only one who was confused.

So pay attention when you get confused, and consider why it
happened. What did you expect to be the case, and how did reality
differ? Explore the angles and the options. Think about what led you
to understand the option you ended up going with. And write it down.

Put it into an internal Markdown doc, an internal Atlassian doc, an
internal Google Slides page, whatever. The medium doesn't matter.

This entire process doesn't come easily. We feel embarrassed. We
aren't used to lingering on something we're confused by. We aren't
used to writing things down.

But if you can make yourself pause and think about what you (or
someone around you) got confused by, and if you can force yourself to
stop getting embarrassed by what you get confused by, and if you can
write down the background and the reasoning that led to your ultimate
understanding, you're going to have something pretty interesting to
talk about.
