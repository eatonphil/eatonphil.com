# Cheerleading

At work we're so absorbed in the difficulties we face that it becomes
easy to forget what we appreciate and what we value in our
coworkers. On social media we can be so focused on our own work that
we forget to interact with others'.

I have heard so many times from founders that they switch between
heads down building, disappearing from the community, and then pop up
to talk about what they've built. Engineers often say the exact same
thing. This kills me. Though I probably still do it to a degree too.

The easiest way for no one to give a shit about what you've done is
for you to only interact at periodic intervals that are only
convenient for you.

With networking in general the most important time to interact and
build relationships is when you do not need anything. By the time you
want someone's support or you want someone to care about what you've
done it is way too late to start building a relationship.

One of the cheapest and most effective avenues to build genuine
relationships is to be the biggest cheerleader you can be.

At work this means when someone writes a fantastic blog post you call
it out in a public channel. It means when a coworker's work is
featured somewhere you call this out in a public channel. At least,
this is what I do at work.

I don't care that I have no leadership role or haven't met these
people before. If I see something amazing that I'd like to see more
of, I mention it in public and praise the person.

Or when someone shares work they've done in a public channel, you hit
all the emojis and you reply "that's awesome".

On social media this means engaging seriously and (more) deeply with
what people post. If the default behavior on social media is to
passively observe, engaging more deeply can be liking a post. If you
already show support through liking, engaging more deeply can be
commenting or asking questions or (kindly) pointing out mistakes.

Engagement is a spectrum. Genuine engagement consistently over time
builds genuine relationships.

I would not suggest that you do this without feeling it, or I'd rather
only encourage you to respond to the degree that you feel. But I
personally do feel so strongly when I cheer people on.

So much of life and work is drudgery such that when you see something
positive, someone taking initiative, someone with talent or potential
doing something with their skills, how can you not feel an
overwhelming urge to cheer them on and hope to see more of it? Hope to
see it develop?

What's more, I want to be around people who are trying new things and
improving themselves. I want to be around people who celebrate. So I
in turn try new things and work to improve myself and I celebrate the
people around me.

This energy is infectious. And I genuinely think even a single person
in a group celebrating publicly changes the group dynamic.

And I don't expect people to reciprocate in the same way or to the
same degree that I show support. I'm particularly weird and confident
and vocal. But if my cheerleading for some person seems like a
complete sink then I'll not continue it and invest my time and energy
elsewhere.

Not everybody needs my support and that's ok! It is better that it's
spent where it's most needed. There were people who used to cheer me
on who don't much anymore and that's totally fine, I still have
positive feelings for them for the time they did cheer me on.

Cheerleading electrifies the work atmosphere. It is the proper use of
social media. Cheerleading is the imperative of caring individuals as
they become more experienced, gain confidence, command a wider
audience, and want to continue their own growth through the
development of genuine and supportive networks.

And an ambitious, high-achieving, celebratory culture is simply the
most fun to be a part of.
