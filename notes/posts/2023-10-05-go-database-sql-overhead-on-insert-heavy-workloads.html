# Go database driver overhead on insert-heavy workloads
## October 5, 2023
###### sqlite,postgres,go,benchmark,databases

The most popular SQLite and PostgreSQL database drivers in Go are
(roughly) 20-76% slower than alternative Go drivers on insert-heavy
benchmarks of mine. So if you are bulk-inserting data with Go (and
potentially also bulk-retrieving data with Go), you may want to
consider the driver carefully. And you may want to consider avoiding
`database/sql`.

Some driver authors have
[noted](https://github.com/lib/pq/issues/771) and
[benchmarked](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/tree/main#benchmark)
issues with
[database/sql](https://github.com/jackc/pgx#choosing-between-the-pgx-and-databasesql-interfaces).

So it may be the case that `database/sql` is responsible for some of
this overhead. And indeed the variations between drivers in this post
will be demonstrated by using `database/sql` and avoiding it. This post
won't specifically prove that the variation is due to the
`database/sql` interface. But that doesn't change the premise.

<p class="note">
  Not covered in this post but something to consider:
  JetBrains <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2023/04/27/comparing-db-packages/">has
  suggested</a> that other frontends like sqlc, sqlx, and GORM do
  worse than <code>database/sql</code>.

This post is built on the workload, environment, libraries, and
methodology in my [databases-intuition repo on
GitHub](https://github.com/eatonphil/databases-intuition). See the
repo for details that will help you reproduce or correct me.

### INSERT workload

In this workload, the data is random and there are no indexes. Neither
of these aspects matter for this post though because we're comparing
behavior within the same database among different drivers. This was
just a workload I already had.

Two different data sizes are tested:

1. 10M rows with 16 columns, each column is 32 bytes
2. 10M rows with 3 columns, each column is 8 bytes

Each test is run 10 times and we record median, standard deviation,
min, max and throughput.

### SQLite

Both variations presented here load 10M rows using a single prepared
statement called for each row within a single transaction.

The most popular driver is
[mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3).

It is roughly 20-40% slower than another driver that avoids
`database/sql`.

10M Rows, 16 columns, each column 32 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 56.53 ± 1.26s, Min: 55.05s, Max: 59.62s
Throughput: 176,893.65 ± 3,853.90 rows/s, Min: 167,719.97 rows/s, Max: 181,646.02 rows/s
```

10M Rows, 3 columns, each column 8 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 15.92 ± 0.25s, Min: 15.69s, Max: 16.67s
Throughput: 628,044.37 ± 9,703.92 rows/s, Min: 599,852.91 rows/s, Max: 637,435.60 rows/s
```

The other driver I tested is my own fork of
[bvinc/go-sqlite-lite](https://github.com/bvinc/go-sqlite-lite) called
[eatonphil/gosqlite](https://github.com/eatonphil/gosqlite). I forked
it because it is unmaintained and I wanted to bring it up-to-date for
tests like this.

10M Rows, 16 columns, each column 32 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 45.51 ± 0.70s, Min: 43.72s, Max: 45.93s
Throughput: 219,729.65 ± 3,447.56 rows/s, Min: 217,742.98 rows/s, Max: 228,711.51 rows/s
```

10M Rows, 3 columns, each column 8 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 10.44 ± 0.20s, Min: 10.02s, Max: 10.68s
Throughput: 957,939.60 ± 18,879.43 rows/s, Min: 936,114.60 rows/s, Max: 998,426.62 rows/s
```

### PostgreSQL

Both variations presented use PostgreSQL's [`COPY
FROM`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html)
support. This is significantly faster for PostgreSQL than doing the
prepared statement we do in
SQLite. ([Here](https://github.com/eatonphil/databases-intuition#postgresql-prepared-insert)
are my results for doing prepared statement INSERTs in PostgreSQL if
you are curious.)

The most popular PostgreSQL driver is
[lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq). The [performance
issues](https://github.com/lib/pq/issues/771) with lib/pq are
[well-known](https://github.com/jackc/pgx#choosing-between-the-pgx-and-databasesql-interfaces),
and the [repo itself](https://github.com/lib/pq#status) is marked as
no longer developed.

It is roughly 44-76% slower than an alternative driver that avoids
`database/sql`.

10M Rows, 16 columns, each column 32 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 104.53 ± 2.40s, Min: 102.57s, Max: 110.08s
Throughput: 95,665.37 ± 2,129.25 rows/s, Min: 90,847.08 rows/s, Max: 97,490.96 rows/s
```

10M Rows, 3 columns, each column 8 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 8.16 ± 0.43s, Min: 7.44s, Max: 8.80s
Throughput: 1,225,986.47 ± 66,631.53 rows/s, Min: 1,136,581.82 rows/s, Max: 1,343,441.37 rows
```

The other driver I tested is
[jackc/pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx), without `database/sql`.

10M Rows, 16 columns, each column 32 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 46.54 ± 1.60s, Min: 44.09s, Max: 49.51s
Throughput: 214,869.42 ± 7,265.10 rows/s, Min: 201,991.37 rows/s, Max: 226,801.07 rows/s
```

10M Rows, 3 columns, each column 8 bytes:

```bash
Timing: 5.20 ± 0.44s, Min: 4.71s, Max: 5.96s
Throughput: 1,923,722.79 ± 156,820.46 rows/s, Min: 1,676,894.32 rows/s, Max: 2,124,966.60 rows/
```

The discrepancies here are even greater than with the different SQLite
drivers.

### Workloads with small resultset

I won't go into as much detail but if you're doing queries that don't
return many rows, the difference between drivers is negligible.

See [here](https://github.com/eatonphil/databases-intuition#selects) for details.

### Conclusion

If you are doing INSERT-heavy workloads, or you are processing large
number of rows returned from your SQL database, you might want to try
benchmarking the same workload with different drivers.

And specifically, there is likely no good reason to use `lib/pq`
anymore for accessing PostgreSQL from Go. Just use jackc/pgx.
