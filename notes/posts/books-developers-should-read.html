<p class="note">
  Originally published on February 1, 2021. The original version
  included two books I don't think are actually so worthwhile. This
  list is down to two. I think that's a good thing actually.

These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.

You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.

### High Performance Browser Networking

If you deal with networks, you would probably benefit from this book.
It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile networks, browser
network protocols, and fundementals of networking.

### Designing Data-Intensive Applications

If you use a database (including an in-memory array of items you
search periodically) or if you build APIs, you would probably benefit
from this book. A solid introduction to distributed computing, data
transfer, indexing, etc.

### That's it!

Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:

* Clean Code
* JavaScript the Good Parts
* Design Patterns/Gang of Four
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* A Philosophy of Software Design

They're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the
investment of your time.
