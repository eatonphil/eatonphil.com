# Year in community

This year I ran three [book club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html)
readings over email with 1,230 unique attendees. I ran 12 [coffee
club](https://eatonphil.com/coffee.html) meetups in midtown Manhattan
with 170 unique attendees. Angelo and I ran 6 [NYC
Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz/) meetups with 12 different speakers
and 281 unique attendees. I took 3 visiting PhD students out for [Banh
Mi](https://eatonphil.com/banhmi.html).

I [raised](https://eatonphil.com/chat.html) $6,915 for educational
non-profits, offering chats in return. I got coffee, lunch, or took 30
minute calls with 55 people I'd never spoken to before in person or on
video. (Most, but not all, were in return for fundraising receipts.)
This list included women and men based in the USA, Germany, Canada,
Nigeria, Nepal, the United Kingdom, Brazil, New Zealand, Israel, and
Australia. (I think I'm forgetting one or two.)

Thank you to every person who has been a part of these efforts, making
them so special and so valuable. See you in the new year!
