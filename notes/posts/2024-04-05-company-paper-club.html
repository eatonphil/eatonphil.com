# A paper reading club at work; databases and distributed systems research

I started a paper reading club this week at work, focused on databases
and distributed systems research. I posted in a general channel about
the premise and asked if anyone was interested. I clarified the
intended topic and that discussions would be asynchronous over email,
run fortnightly.

Weekly seemed way too often. A month seemed way too
infrequent. Fortnightly seemed decent.

I was nervous to do this because I've been here about 2 months. In the
past I would have waited 6 months or a year to do this. But I don't
know. If you see something you think should exist, why wait?

The only other consideration was [past experiences I've written
about](https://notes.eatonphil.com/eight-years-of-tech-meetups.html)
having difficulty getting engagement with clubs at work. But EDB has
near 1,000 employees. I figured there might at least be a couple
interested.

Furthermore I figured if I only got a few people this entire idea
would at least benefit myself, since I have been wanting to force
myself to build a paper reading habit. And if no one responded, it
would be only mildly embarassing and I'd not pursue it further.

But after a day, about 6 people showed interest. Which was better than
I hoped! Folks from product management, support, development, and
beyond.

So I opened a dedicated channel and asked people to start submitting
papers and voting on them. One of my teammates started submitting some
great papers on caches and reference counting.

I picked a first one, the Redshift paper, to get us started.
Demonstrating the process to avoid confusion. And I made a calendar
invite for everyone in the channel, the paper linked in the invite. I
clarified in the invite that it was just a reminder and that the real
discussion would still be async over email. (I've found it's best to
repeatedly clarify process stuff.)

Once I had these first few folks interested I was able to post again
in a broader company channel that a couple of us were starting this
paper club. By the end of the day the dedicated channel was 29
folks. All in about 2 days.

Mailing lists are nicer than Slack or Discord in my opinion because
they sort of force you to slow down, they are harder to miss (if
someone starts a thread after you've seen a message in Slack or
Discord, you tend to miss it), and easier to manage
(read/unread).

Engineers often seem to get overwhelmed by a mass of Slack
messages. Whereas they seem to be a bit more comfortable with email
threads.

All of this is all the more important when you're running a global
group. EDB has people everywhere.

Why do this?

Before I dropped out of college I did a research internship with a
VLSI group at Harvard SEAS. And my favorite part was that they had a
weekly (or biweekly?) Wednesday paper reading session where 15 people
from the lab and adjacent labs would eat pizza after hours and discuss
a paper.

I've been dying to recreate this at a company ever since. Since EDB is
so distributed, we won't be discussing over pizza. But I'm still
excited.

And I hope my experience serves as a blueprint for others.
