# Active and influential NYC infrastructure people
## November 15, 2024
###### humans,nyc

These are some of the most influential (mostly due to experience or
expertise) and active folks (I actually see them attend events) in the
NYC infrastructure scene (that I have a personal connection to).

If you're running a dinner or are just looking to meet interesting
people in NYC in software infrastructure, consider this list and feel
free to mention "Phil said you are awesome".

I've normalized titles a little bit but I say every title in the most
generous way. These folks are brilliant.

This list is intentionally randomized. Also not a complete list. I've
surely forgotten (let alone not yet met) great folk.
