# Cool things you can do with /proc

How often do you use `netstat` or `ps` or `pstree`? How often do you
try to look up how to discover something related to a process, just to
be told you need to install some hipster command line tool like `lsof`
or `ss` just to solve that problem?

Well, the neat thing is that all (?) of this information is available
for you in `/proc`. `/proc` is a [virtual
filesystem](https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html)
with information about all running processes.

<p class="note">
  The nasty thing about <code>/proc</code> is that there doesn't seem
  to be any way to access its info as structured data. The official
  Linux interface to process info is... text files...
</p>

There is a folder inside `/proc` for every process that is currently
running.

Here are a few useful recipes to get you started.

### Find the parent process ID of some process by process ID

```bash
$ cat /proc/$pid/status | grep PPid | awk '{print $2}'
```

### Find all open ports by process ID
