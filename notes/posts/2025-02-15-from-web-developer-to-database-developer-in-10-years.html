# From web developer to database developer in 10 years
## February 15, 2025
###### career

Last month I completed my first year at EnterpriseDB. I'm on the team
that built and maintains
[pglogical](https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical) and who, over
the years, contributed a good chunk of the logical replication
functionality that exists in community Postgres. Most of my work, our
work, is in C and Rust with tests in Perl and Python. Our focus these
days is a descendant of pglogical called [Postgres
Distributed](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/) which
supports replicating DDL, tunable consistency across the cluster, etc.

### Black boxes

I was a web developer from 2014-2021†. I wrote
JavaScript and HTML and CSS and whatever server-side language: Python
or Go or PHP. I was a hands-on engineering manager from 2017-2021. I
was pretty clueless about databases and indeed database knowledge was
not a serious part of any interview I did.

Throughout that time (2014-2021) I wanted to move my career forward as
quickly as possible so I spent much of my free time doing educational
projects and writing about them on this blog (or previous incarnations
of it). I learned how to write primitive HTTP servers, how to write
little parsers and interpreters and compilers. It was a virtuous cycle
because the internet (Hacker News anyway) liked reading these posts
and I wanted to learn how the black boxes worked.

But I shied away from data structures and algorithms (DSA) because
they seemed complicated and useless to the work that I did. That is,
until 2020 when an inbox page I built started loading more and more slowly as
the inbox grew. My coworker pointed me at [Use The Index,
Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/) and the DSA scales fell from my
eyes. I wanted to understand this new black box so I [built a little
in-memory SQL
database](https://notes.eatonphil.com/database-basics.html) with
support for indexes.

I'm a college dropout so even while I was interested in compilers and
interpreters earlier in my career I never dreamed I could get a job
working on them. Only geniuses and PhDs did that work and I was
neither. However, I could keep working on little database side
projects like I always had before, [so I
did](https://notes.eatonphil.com/tags/databases.html). Or a [series of
explorations](https://notes.eatonphil.com/tags/raft.html) of Raft
implementations, others' and my own.

### Startups

From 2021-2023 I tried to start [a
company](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation) and when that
didn't pan out I joined TigerBeetle as a cofounder to work on
marketing and community. It was during this time I started the
[Software Internals Discord](https://eatonphil.com/discord.html) and
[/r/databasedevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/)
which have since kind of exploded in popularity among professionals
and academics in database and distributed systems.

TigerBeetle was my first job at a database company, and while I
contributed bits of code I was not a developer there. Still it was an
incredible learning experience both on the cofounder side and on the
database side. I wrote articles with King and Joran that helped teach
and affirm for myself the basics of databases and consensus-based
distributed systems.

### Holding out

When I left TigerBeetle in 2023 I was still not sure if I
could get a job as an actual database developer. My network had
exploded since 2021 (when I started my own company that didn't pan out)
so I had no trouble getting referrals at database companies.

But my background kept leading hiring managers to suggest putting me
on cloud teams doing orchestration in Go around a database rather than
working on the database itself. I was unhappy with this type-casting
so I held out while unemployed and continued to write posts and [host
virtual hackweeks](https://eatonphil.com/archive.html) messing with
Postgres and MySQL. I started the [first
incarnation](https://eatonphil.com/2024-database-design-and-implementation.html)
of the Software Internals Book Club during this time, reading
Designing Data Intensive Applications with 5-20 other developers in
Bryant Park. During this time I also started the [NYC Systems Coffee
Club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html).

### Postgres

After about four months of searching I ended up with three good
offers, all to do C and Rust development on Postgres (extensions) as
an individual contributor. Working on extensions might sound like the
definition of not-sexy but Postgres APIs are so loosely abstracted
it's really as if you're working on Postgres itself.

You can mess with almost anything in Postgres so you really have to be
very aware of what you're doing. And where you can't mess with
something in Postgres because an API doesn't yet exist, companies have
the tendency to just fork Postgres so they can. (This tendency isn't
specific to Postgres, almost every open-source database company has a
long-running internal fork or two of the database.)

### EnterpriseDB

Two of the three offers were from early-stage startups and after more
than 3 years being part of the earliest stages of startups I was happy
for a break. Moreover the third offer was from [one of the biggest
contributors](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/Which-Companies-Supporting-PostgreSQL-Development)
to Postgres, EnterpriseDB. I think you can probably come up with
different rankings of companies using different metrics so I'm only
saying EnterpriseDB is one of the biggest contributors.

It seemed like the best place to be to learn a lot and contribute
something meaningful.

My coworkers are a mix of Postgres veterans (men and women who
contributed the WAL to Postgres, who contributed MVCC to Postgres, who
contributed logical decoding and logical replication, who contributed
parallel queries, and the list goes on and on) but also my
developer-coworkers are people who started at EnterpriseDB on
technical support, or who were previously Postgres administrators.

It's quite a mix. Relatively few geniuses or PhDs, despite what I used
to think, but they certainly work hard and have hard-earned
experience.

Anyway, I've now been working at EnterpriseDB for over a year so I
wanted to share this retrospective. I wanted to cover what it's like
coming from engineering management and founding companies to going
back to being an individual contributor.

Spoiler: incredibly fun, and astounding to think of all the limitations
we put on ourselves based on our job description but that don't
actually exist. But it has been hard enough to make myself write this
much so I'm calling it a day.

† From 2011-2014 I also did contract web development but this was
part-time while I was in school.
