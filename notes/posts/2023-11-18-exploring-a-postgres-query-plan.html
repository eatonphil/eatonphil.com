# Exploring a Postgres query plan
## November 18, 2023
###### c,postgres

I learned from [a friend](https://twitter.com/philippemnoel) this week
that you can intercept and redirect Postgres query execution. You can
hook into the execution layer so you're given a query plan and you
decide what to do with it. What rows to return, if any, and where they
come from.

That's very interesting and I started writing code to explore
execution hooks. However, I got stuck interpreting the query
plan. Either there's no query plan walking infrastructure or I just
didn't find it.

So this post is a digression into walking a Postgres query plan that
I'll use as the basis for future work on something like redirecting
Postgres query execution to read from a CSV or translate a query plan
into SQLite to query a SQLite file.

By the end of the post we'll be able to run the query `psql -c 'SELECT
a FROM x WHERE a > 1'` and reconstruct the entire SQL string from a
Postgres `QueryDesc*` object.

With that query plan walking infrastructure in place, we'd be in a
good state to not just print out the query plan while walking it but
instead to translate the query plan or evaluate it in our own way
(e.g. over column-wise data, or [vectorized execution over row-wise
data](https://github.com/citusdata/postgres_vectorization_test)).

### What is a query plan?

If you're familiar with parsers and compilers, a query plan is like an
intermediate representation of a program. It is not as raw as an AST;
it's already been optimized.

If that doesn't mean anything to you, consider a query plan to be a
structured and optimized version of the SQL query you submit to your
database.

Check out Justin Jaffray's [article on the
subject](https://justinjaffray.com/what-is-a-query-optimizer-for/) for
more detail.

### Development environment

Before we get to walking the query plan, let's set up the
infrastructure to intercept query execution where we can eventually
add in our print debugging of the query plan reconstructed as a SQL
string.

Once you've got [Postgres build
dependencies](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Compile_and_Install_from_source_code),
build and install a debug version of Postgres:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/postgres/postgres && cd postgres
$ # Make sure you're on the same commit I'm on, just to be safe.
$ git checkout b218fbb7a35fcf31539bfad12732038fe082a2eb
$ ./configure --enable-cassert --enable-debug CFLAGS="-ggdb -Og -g3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
$ make -j8
# Installs to to /usr/local/pgsql/bin.
$ sudo make install
```

I'm not going to cover Postgres extension infrastructure in detail. I
wrote a bit about it in [my last
post](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-11-01-postgres-table-access-methods.html)
which you can catch up on if you'd like (the first half, not the
actual Table Access Method implementation).

It will be even simpler here because Postgres hooks are extensions but
not an extension you install with `CREATE EXTENSION`. (If you want to
read about the different kinds of Postgres extensions, check out [this
article](https://tembo.io/blog/four-types-of-extensions/) by Steven
Miller.)

The minimum we do need aside from the hook code itself is a Makefile
that uses
[PGXS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html):

```Make
MODULES = pgexec

PG_CONFIG = /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
```

The `MODULES` value there corresponds to the C file we'll write
shortly, `pgexec.c`.

<p class="note">
  This <code>pg_config</code> binary path is important because you
  might have different versions of Postgres installed, for example by
  your package manager. It is important that the extension is built
  against the same version of Postgres which will load the extension.
</p>

Now we're ready for some hook code.

### Intercepting query execution

You can find the basic structure of a hook (and which hooks are
available) in Tamika Nomara's [unofficial Postgres hooks
docs](https://github.com/taminomara/psql-hooks).

<p class="note">
  There is no official central place describing all hooks I could find
  in Postgres docs. Some hooks are described in various places
  throughout the docs though.
<p>

Based on that page, we can write a bare minimum hook that will
intercept all queries, log when we've done so, and pass control back
to the standard execution path for the actual query. In `pgexec.c`:

```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"
#include "executor/executor.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

static ExecutorRun_hook_type prev_executor_run_hook = NULL;

static void pgexec_run_hook(
  QueryDesc* queryDesc,
  ScanDirection direction,
  uint64 count,
  bool execute_once
) {
  elog(LOG, "HOOKED SUCCESSFULLY!");
  return prev_executor_run_hook(queryDesc, direction, count, execute_once);
}

void _PG_init(void) {
  prev_executor_run_hook = ExecutorRun_hook;
  if (prev_executor_run_hook == NULL) {
    prev_executor_run_hook = standard_ExecutorRun;
  }
  ExecutorRun_hook = pgexec_run_hook;
}

void _PG_fini(void) {
  ExecutorRun_hook = prev_executor_run_hook;
}
```

I learned about the `standard_ExectutorRun` hook from a quick `git
grep ExecutorRun_hook` in the Postgres source which leads to
[src/backend/executor/execMain.c#L306](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/b218fbb7a35fcf31539bfad12732038fe082a2eb/src/backend/executor/execMain.c#L306):

```c
void
ExecutorRun(QueryDesc *queryDesc,
			ScanDirection direction, uint64 count,
			bool execute_once)
{
	if (ExecutorRun_hook)
		(*ExecutorRun_hook) (queryDesc, direction, count, execute_once);
	else
		standard_ExecutorRun(queryDesc, direction, count, execute_once);
}
```

So our hook will just log and pass back execution to the existing
execution hook. Let's build and install the extension.

```console
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Now we'll create a new database and tell it to load the extension.

```console
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb test-db
$ echo "shared_preload_libraries = 'pgexec'" > test-db/postgresql.conf
```

And start the server in the foreground:

```console
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres \
  --config-file=$(pwd)/test-db/postgresql.conf \
  -D $(pwd)/test-db
  -k $(pwd)/test-db

```

Keep an eye on this foreground process since this is where `elog(LOG,
...)` calls will show up.

Now in a new window, run `psql` and let's get something to log:

```console
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -h localhost postgres
psql (17devel)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# SELECT 1;
 ?column?
----------
        1
(1 row)
```

And in the `postgres` foreground process you should see a log:

```
2023-11-18 19:38:56.990 GMT [3216394] LOG:  HOOKED SUCCESSFULLY!
2023-11-18 19:38:56.990 GMT [3216394] STATEMENT:  SELECT 1;
```

That's our hook! Now let's see if we can reconstruct the query text
from that first argument, the `QueryDesc*` that `pgexec_run_hook`
receives.

### `QueryDesc*`
