# A healthy relationship with writing

Everyone thinks they should write. It's exciting to have readers, to
see the views number. It means an expanded funnel for your company or
for your personal network.

We get so worked up about the importance of writing that we don't do
it. We polish and polish and polish. Or start overthinking: who'd even
want to read this in the first place. Did I say something novel?

And then we publish and share on social media and get 5 likes and 30
page views and that feels crappy. Why did we put all that effort in?

For most work, for most products, readers don't care about the
outcome. But they are almost always interested in the journey. (And
they care even more about the journey if they did also care about the
outcome.)

So there's a pretty strong incentive to write more about your journey
than about your outcome. And what this means is that you're writing
things that teach people based on what you learned.
