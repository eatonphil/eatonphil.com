# Things that go wrong with disk IO

###### disks,databases,linux

There are a few interesting scenarios to keep in mind when writing
applications (not just databases!) that interact with read and writes
files, particularly in transactional contexts where you actually care
about the integrity of the data and when you are editing data in place
(versus copy-on-write for example).

If I don't say otherwise I'm talking about behavior on Linux.

The research version of this blog post is [Parity Lost and Parity
Regained](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/fast08/tech/full_papers/krioukov/krioukov.pdf)
and [Characteristics, Impact, and Tolerance of Partial Disk
Failures](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=8e486139d944cc7291666082bc5a74814af6e388).

These two papers also go into the frequency of some of the issues
discussed here. These behaviors actually happen in real life!

Thank you to Alex Miller and George Xanthakis for reviewing a draft of
this post.

### Terminology

Some of these terms are reused in different contexts, and sometimes
they are reused because they effectively mean the same thing in a
certain configuration. But I'll try to be explicit to avoid confusion.

#### Sector

The smallest amount of data that can be read and written atomically by
hardware. It used to be 512 bytes, but on modern disks it is often
4KiB. There doesn't seem to be any safe assumption you can make about
sector size, despite file system defaults (see below). You must check
your disks to know.

#### Block (filesystem/kernel view)

Typically set to the sector size since only this block size is
atomic. The [default in ext4 is
4KiB](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ext4/overview.html).

#### Page (kernel view)

A disk block that is in memory. Any reads/writes less than the size of
a block will read the entire block into kernel memory even if less
than that amount is sent back to userland.

#### Page (database/application view)

The smallest amount of data the system (database, application, etc.)
chooses to act on, when it's read or written or held in memory. The
page size is some multiple of the filesystem/kernel block size
(including the multiple being 1). SQLite's [default page
size](https://www.sqlite.org/pgszchng2016.html) is 4KiB. MySQL's
[default page
size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_page_size)
is 16KiB. Postgres's [default page
size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-page-layout.html)
is 8KiB.

### Things that go wrong

#### The data didn't reach disk

By default, file writes succeed when the data is copied into kernel
memory (buffered IO). The man page for
[write(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html) says:

> A successful return from write() does not make any guarantee that
data has been committed to disk.  On some filesystems, including NFS,
it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved
for the data.  In this case, some errors might be delayed until a
future write(), fsync(2), or even close(2).  The only way to be sure
is to call fsync(2) after you are done writing all your data.

If you don't call fsync on Linux the data isn't necessarily durably on
disk, and if the system crashes or restarts before the disk writes the
data to non-volatile storage, you may lose data.

With
[O_DIRECT](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html#:~:text=O_DIRECT%20%28since%20Linux%202.4.10%29),
file writes succeed when the data is copied to at least the *disk
cache*. Alternatively you could open the file with O_DIRECT|O_SYNC
(or O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC) and forgo fsync calls.

fsync on macOS is a no-op.

If you're confused, read [Userland Disk
I/O](https://transactional.blog/how-to-learn/disk-io).

Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, MySQL fsync data before considering a
transaction successful by default. RocksDB does not.

#### The data was fsynced but fsync failed

fsync isn't guaranteed to succeed. And when it fails you can't tell
which write failed. It [may not even be a failure of a write to a file
that your process
opened](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/vfs.html):

> Ideally, the kernel would report errors only on file descriptions
on which writes were done that subsequently failed to be written
back. The generic pagecache infrastructure does not track the file
descriptions that have dirtied each individual page however, so
determining which file descriptors should get back an error is not
possible.

> Instead, the generic writeback error tracking infrastructure in the
kernel settles for reporting errors to fsync on all file descriptions
that were open at the time that the error occurred. In a situation
with multiple writers, all of them will get back an error on a
subsequent fsync, even if all of the writes done through that
particular file descriptor succeeded (or even if there were no writes
on that file descriptor at all).

Don't be [2018-era Postgres](https://danluu.com/fsyncgate/).

The only way to have known which exact write failed would be to open
the file with O_DIRECT|O_SYNC (or O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC), though this
is not the only way to handle fsync failures.

#### The data was corrupted

If you don't checksum your data on write and check the checksum on
read (as well as periodic scrubbing a la ZFS) you will never be aware
if and when the data gets corrupted and you will have to restore (who
knows how far back in time) from backups if and when you notice.

[ZFS](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/Checksums.html),
MongoDB
([WiredTiger](https://source.wiredtiger.com/develop/tune_checksum.html)),
MySQL
([InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_checksum_algorithm)),
and
[RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Full-File-Checksum-and-Checksum-Handoff)
checksum data by default. Postgres and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/cksumvfs.html) do not (though
[databases created from Postgres
18+](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/04bec894a04c) will).

You should probably turn on checksums on any system that supports it,
regardless of the default.

#### The data was partially written

Only when the page size you write = block size of your filesystem =
sector size of your disk is a write guaranteed to be atomic. If you
need to write multiple sectors of data atomically there is the risk
that some sectors are written and then the system crashes or
restarts. This is called torn writes or torn pages.

[Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Full_page_writes),
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/psow.html), and MySQL
([InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/glossary.html#glos_torn_page))
handle torn writes. Torn writes are by definition not relevant to
immutable storage systems like RocksDB (and other LSM Tree or
Copy-on-Write systems like MongoDB (WiredTiger)) unless writes (that
update *metadata*) span sectors.

If your file system duplicates all writes like MySQL (InnoDB) does
(like you can with [data=journal in
ext4](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/129507)) you may also not have
to worry about torn writes. On the other hand, this amplifies writes
2x.

#### The data didn't reach disk, part 2

Sometimes fsync succeeds but the data isn't actually on disk because
the disk is lying. These are called lost writes or phantom writes. You
can be resilient to phantom writes by always reading back what you
wrote (expensive) or versioning what you wrote.

Databases and file systems generally do not seem to handle this
situation.

#### The data was written to the wrong place, read from the wrong place

If you aren't including where data is supposed to be on disk as part
of the checksum or page itself, you risk being unaware that you wrote
data to the wrong place or that you read from the wrong place. This is
called misdirected writes/reads.

Databases and file systems generally do not seem to handle this
situation.
