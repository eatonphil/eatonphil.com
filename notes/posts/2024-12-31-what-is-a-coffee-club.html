# How I run a coffee club

I started the NYC Systems Coffee Club in December 2023. Around 20
people meet each month at an indoor public space near Bryant Park and
chat. It's simple. You buy a drink elsewhere if you feel like it and
you hang out with people.

There is no agenda, there is no speaker, there is no structure. The
only "structure" is that when the circle of people talking to each
other seems gets too big, I break the circle up into two smaller circles so
we can get more conversations going.

People tend to talk in a little circle and then move around over
time. It's basically no different than a happy hour except it is over
a non-alcoholic drink and it's in the morning.

All I have to do as the organizer is periodically tell people about
the [Google Form](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html)
to fill out. I got people to sign up to the list by posting about this
on Twitter and LinkedIn. And then once a month I send an email bcc-ing
everyone on the list and ask them to respond for an invite.

The first 20 people to respond get a calendar invite.

I mention all of this because people ask how they can start a coffee
club in their city. They ask how it works. But it's very simple! One
of the least-effortful ways to bring together people in your city.

If your city does not have indoor public spaces, you could use a
food court, or a cafe, or a park during months where it is warm.

Good luck! :)
