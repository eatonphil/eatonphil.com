Hey [Redacted]! It's great to hear from you. I'm very glad you joined
the [coffee club](https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html)
and met some good folks. :)

You asked how to learn about systems. A great question! I think I need
to start first with what I mean when I say systems.

My definition of systems is all of the underlying software we
developers use but are taught not to think about because they are so
solid: our compilers and interpreters, our databases, our operating
system, our browser, and so on. We think of them as basically not
having bugs, we just count on them to be correct and fast enough so we
can build the applications that really matter to users.

But 1) some developers do actually have to work on these fundamental
blocks (compilers, databases, operating systems, browsers, etc.) and
2) it's not thaaaat hard to get into this development professionally
and 3) even if you don't get into it professionally, having a better
understanding of these fundamental blocks will make you a better
application developer. At least I think so.

To get into systems I think it starts by you just questioning how each
layer you build on works. Try building that layer yourself. For
example you've probably used a web framework like Rails or
Next.js. But you can just go and write that layer yourself too (for
education).

And you've probably used Postgres or SQLite or DynamoDB. But you can
also just go and write that layer yourself (for education). It's this
habit of thinking and digging into the next lower layer that will get
you into systems. Basically, not being satisfied with the black box.

I do not think there are many good books on programming in general,
and very very few must-read ones, but one that I recommend to
everybody is Designing Data Intensive Applications. I think it's best
if you read it with a group of people. (My [book club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html) will read it in
December when the 2nd edition comes out, you should join.) But this
book is specific to data obviously and not interested in the
fundamentals of other systems things like compilers or operating
systems or browsers or so on.

Also, I see getting into this as a long-term thing. Throughout my
whole career (almost 11 years now) I definitely always tried to dig
into compilers and interpreters, I wrote and blogged about toy
implementations a lot. And then 5 years ago I started digging into
databases and saw that there was more career potential there. But it
still took 4 years until I got my first job as a developer working on
a database (the job I currently have).

Things take time to learn and that's ok! You have a long career to
look forward to. And if you end up not wanting to dig into this stuff
that's totally fine too. I think very few developers actually do. And
they still have fine careers.

Anyway, I hope this is at least mildly useful. I hope you join
[nycsystems.xyz](https://nycsystems.xyz/) as well and look forward to
seeing you at future coffee clubs!

Cheers,

Phil
