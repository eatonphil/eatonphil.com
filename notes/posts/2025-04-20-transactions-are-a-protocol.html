# Transactions are a protocol

Transactions are not an intrinsic part of a storage system. Any
storage system can be made transactional: Redis, S3, the filesystem,
etc. [Delta Lake](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3411-armbrust.pdf)
and [Orleans](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol17/p3720-eldeeb.pdf)
demonstrated techniques to make S3 (or cloud storage in general)
transactional. [Epoxy](https://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf)
demonstrated techniques to make Redis (and any other system)
transactional. And of course there's always good old [Two-Phase
Commit](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/post/2008-11-27-consensus-protocols-two-phase-commit/).

If you don't want to read those papers, I wrote about a [simplified
implementation](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-09-29-build-a-serverless-acid-database-with-this-one-neat-trick.html)
of Delta Lake and also wrote about a [simplified MVCC
implementation](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-05-16-mvcc.html) over
a generic key-value storage layer.

It is both the beauty and the burden of transactions that they are not
intrinsic to a storage system. Postgres and MySQL and SQLite have
transactions. But you don't need to use them. It isn't possible to
require you to use transactions. Many developers, myself a few years
ago included, do not know why you should use them. (Hint: read
*Designing Data Intensive Applications*.)

And you can take it even further by ignoring the transaction layer of
an existing transactional database and implement your own transaction
layer as [Convex has
done](https://stack.convex.dev/how-convex-works#the-transaction-log)
(the Epoxy paper above also does this). It isn't entirely clear that
you have a lot to lose by implementing your own transaction layer
since the indexes you'd want on the version field of a value would
only be as expensive or slow as any other secondary index in a
transactional database. Though why you'd do this isn't entirely clear
(I will like to read about this from Convex some time).

It's useful to see transaction protocols as another tool in your
system design tool chest when you care about consistency, atomicity,
and isolation. Especially as you build systems that span data
systems. Maybe, as Ben Hindman hinted at the last [NYC
Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz/2025/april.html), even proprietary
APIs will eventually provide something like two-phase commit so
physical systems outside our control can become transactional too.
