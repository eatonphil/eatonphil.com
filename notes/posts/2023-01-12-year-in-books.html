# The year in books: 11 to recommend from 2022

###### books

In 2022 I [finished 20
books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11636-2022-reading-challenge)
spanning 15,801 pages.  3 more than I read in 2021, but about twice
the number of pages. 3 fiction and 17 non-fiction. Another ~30 started
but not finished.

I had a hard time reading books while I was trying to start my own
company. But I also discovered audiobooks. I would put on a book and
listen while I did my chores. Only 5 of the 20 books I finished were
physical (or kindle) books. The other 15 were audiobooks.

### Non-fiction

After I started read Robert Caro's Master of the Senate I got hooked
on history and felt less daunted about larger books.

The only non-fiction I read in 2022 was US and UK history.

Here were my favorites:

* [Master of the
  Senate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86525.Master_of_the_Senate)
  by Robert Caro: Covering more than just Lyndon B. Johnson but the
  history of the Senate and the Civil Rights movements in the US. This
  book is now on my [list of best
  books](https://lists.eatonphil.com/book-recommendations.html).
* [The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Visions of Glory,
  1874-1932](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19809.The_Last_Lion)
  by William Manchester: First in a three-volume series about
  Churchill. He's an especially interesting guy to read about because
  he served in UK politics 1901 to his retirement (for the second
  time) as UK Prime Minister in 1955. He was First Lord of the
  Admiralty in World War 1 before he, more famously, become Prime
  Minister during World War 2. This entire series is on my list of
  best books.
* [The Autobiography of Martin Luther King,
  Jr.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42547.The_Autobiography_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr_):
  Sad and revealing. Though it doesn't talk much about his legacy
  since it only includes his writings.
* [Passage of
  Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13049569-the-passage-of-power)
  by Robert Caro: Covering LBJ's pathetic failed attempts at the
  presidency before becoming JFK's Vice President, up to JFK's
  assassination. Still a very good book. I can't wait for Caro's final
  book to come out.
* [Truman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2279.Truman) by David
  McCullough: I always thought Truman was a lame nerd but he actually
  had a very interesting life (and as I'd later discover, is far from
  the lamest president. Wilson hands down takes that place.) And
  unlike most other famous politicians I read about, he had a great
  relationship with his wife. He was honest and respectable and was
  the first US president to normalize relations with Mexico since the
  Mexican-American War (that U.S. Grant and Robert E. Lee fought in in
  the 1840s).
* [The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Alone,
  1932-40](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55751.The_Last_Lion) by
  William Manchester: The second book in the series. Pretty
  depressing because it's a decade of Churchill noticing Nazi German
  behavior and stressing UK preparedness and the UK ignoring him and
  Nazi Germany.
* [The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Defender of the Realm,
  1940-1965](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/746673.The_Last_Lion)
  by William Manchester: The final book in the series, covering his
  Prime Ministership.
* [Eleanor Roosevelt, Volume 1: The Early Years,
  1884-1933](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/884536.Eleanor_Roosevelt_Volume_1)
  by Blanche Wiesen Cook: Her background and many problems, as the
  daughter of Theodore Roosevelt's brother and later husband of their
  distant cousin, is pretty hard to relate to. Still it was quite
  interesting to hear about her life and early activities how she
  became such an outspoken progressive activist from being quite
  conservative.
* [Abraham Lincoln: A Life, Volume One] by Michael Burlingame
