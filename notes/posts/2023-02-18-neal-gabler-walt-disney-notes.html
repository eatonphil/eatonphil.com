# Notes from Neal Gabler's Walt Disney

###### books,unpolished

Disney was a celebrity by his mid-30s, Disney the company was famous
by 1930s.

Even though politically the 1930s was considered the decade of
Roosevelt (elected President in 1933), culturally the 1930s was
considered the decade of Mickey Mouse.

Almost every new animation/filmmaking technique they tried, they would
experiment with it in shorts (Silly Symphonies) before applying to big
films like Snow White. Examples of this include:

- Multiple layers of animation moving independently to create depth in
  [The Old Mill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYEmL0d0lZE)
- The first Disney animations with humans (not flora/fauna) like [The
  Cookie Carnival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRB2YlQOSBI)

Nobody took animation seriously, didn't think there was much
possibility for it in film. Disney kept pushing the envelope. Some
examples include:

- Not including the hand inside the drawing ([though early Disney ones
  did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERokauUI6TA))
- Eventually focusing on actual stories, not just gags/jokes
- Sound (the famous Mickey [Steamboat Willie
  animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4), [read

- Merchandise, not just the art
- [Feature films (i.e. Snow White in 1937, the first animated feature
  film), not just shorts](https://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/557744)
- Brought Hollywood to Television
    - "Walt Disney signed an exclusive long-term contract today with
      the American Broadcasting Company to become the first leading
      Hollywood producer to enter into formal alliance with
      television. [NY

### Snow White

Disney hired fine arts teachers to come and teach employees. From time
to time he forced the artists to take night classes.

They trained for years(?) before *starting* the animation of Snow
White and did almost all the animation in the last 10 months or so
before the release in December 1937.

They had to do 24-hour animation in 8 hour shifts to get up to
speed. They had to hire 100s of animators to do fill in work so the
“master” animators could focus on “drawing the extremes”.

The average age at Disney was 25. These days of the 1930s really felt
quite similar to what a Silicon Valley startup is thought to be.

Disney preferred to hire recent art school students so they could
train them in the Disney style.

They could not animate humans during Snow White well enough so they
ended up just tracing them, called
[rotoscoping](https://imgur.com/gallery/IZkSR).

The Snow White voice cast were quite famous at the time. We wouldn't
know it now but it was basically an ensemble cast.

### World War 2

Ran low on money so they produced films for the [US
Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney%27s_World_War_II_productions_for_Armed_Forces). [Propaganda](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-disney-propaganda-shaped-life-on-the-home-front-during-wwii-180979057/),
basically. But also [instructional
videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRVFQs2XYy4).

[Disney workers began striking
(1941)](https://animationguild.org/about-the-guild/disney-strike-1941/)
and established unions. If Disney was a dick before this, he became a
much bigger dick after this.

### Post War

Got into television with ABC initially. First Hollywood company to do
so. Arrangement with ABC was in part to finance Disneyland. (Not
covered in the book but Disney [eventually took over
ABC](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/01/business/media-business-merger-walt-disney-acquire-abc-19-billion-deal-build-giant-for.html),
not before eventually splitting ABC and working with NBC though.)

Disney stopped caring about films and moved to mostly thinking about
Disneyland, this under WED (what is now Walt Disney Imagineering).

After Disneyland launched he moved on to world fairs and eventually
Disneyworld. He died of lung cancer before completing Disneyworld.

### Tidbits

- [The Reluctant
  Dragon](https://www.disneyplus.com/video/aa400cf1-a54d-4187-997d-573711c88697),
  a throwaway film because they needed money when they went public. It
  is the story of a children's book author trying to get Disney to
  make a film out of his book. He stumbles around the new Disney
  Burbank Studio through art classes and musicians practicing,
  uncovering how Disney films are made in the process.

### Questions

- What were the other major animation studies? Even if Snow White was
  the first animated feature film, surely others must have rushed to
  copy the success. Who were they?
    - UPA (Mr Magoo) was one. Also Warner Brothers

### Conclusion

Basically after every turn he'd get tired of the stuff he had already
done (and killed at doing) to do something new. From animated shorts
to feature films to television to Disneyland to Disneyworld and EPCOT.

To his employees he was a huge dick. They'd be in constant fear of
upsetting him and getting fired. And he admitted that he would
basically fire people randomly. He'd fire anyone important enough to
get their name on a door (i.e. establish their own fiefdom within the
company). But it seems more like Disney the company worked in spite of
this rather than because of this.

**After Mary Poppins (1964, two years before he died): "I'm on the
spot. I have to keep trying to keep up to that same level. And the way
to do it is not to worry, not to get tense. Not to think, 'I got to
beat Mary Poppins', 'I got to beat Mary Poppins'. The way to do it is
just to go off and get interested in some little thing, some little
idea that interests me. Some little idea that looks like fun."**
