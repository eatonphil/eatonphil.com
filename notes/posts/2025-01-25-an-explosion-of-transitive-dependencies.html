# An explosion of transitive dependencies

A small standard library means an explosion in transitive
dependencies. A more comprehensive standard library helps you minimize
dependencies. Don't misunderstand me: in a real-world project, it is
practically impossible to have zero dependencies.

Armin Ronacher
[called](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/) for a
vibe shift among programmers and I think that this actually exists
already. Everyone I speak to on this topic has agreed that minimizing
dependencies is ideal.

Rust and JavaScript, with their incredibly minimal standard libraries,
[work against this
ideal](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-03-15-zig-rust-and-other-languages.html#standard-library). Go,
Python, Java, and C# in contrast have a decent standard library, which
helps minimize the explosion of transitive dependencies.

### Examples

I think the standard library should reasonably include:

- JSON, CSV, and Parquet support
- HTTP/2 support (which includes TLS, compression, random number generation, etc.)
- Support for asynchronous IO
- A logging abstraction
- A SQL client abstraction
- Key abstract data types (BTrees, hashmaps, sets, and growable arrays)
- Utilities for working with Unicode, time and timezones

But I don't think it needs to include:

- Excel support
- PostgreSQL or Oracle clients
- Flatbuffers support
- Niche data structures

Neither of these are intended to be complete lists, just examples.

### Walled gardens

Minimal standard libraries force companies earlier on as they grow to
build out their own internal collection of "standard libraries". This
allows larger companies to avoid the explosion of transitive
dependencies over time. All companies likely do something like this
over time as they grow. But again, smaller standard libraries
incentivizes companies to build this internal standard library earlier
on.

In contrast, smaller organizations do not have the resources to foster
such an internal ecosystem. Smaller organizations and the community
overall do not benefit from the internal standard libraries of larger
organizations.

Maybe it will lead to libraries like Boost for
JavaScript and Rust programmers. This could be fine.

### Versioning

A comprehensive standard library does not prevent the
language developers from releasing new versions of the standard
library. It is trivial to do this with naming like Go has done
with the [v2](https://go.dev/blog/v2-go-modules)
pattern. [math/rand/v2](https://go.dev/blog/randv2) is an example.

### Conclusion

My concern about the standard library does not stop me from using
Rust and JavaScript. Furthermore, they could choose to invest in the standard
library at any time. We have already begun to see
[Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3) and [Deno](https://jsr.io/@std)
to do exactly this. But it is clearly an area
for improvement in Rust and JavaScript. And a mistake for other
languages to avoid repeating.
