# An explosion of transitive dependencies

A small standard library means an explosion in transitive
dependencies. A more comprehensive standard library helps you minimize
dependencies. Don't misunderstand me: in a real-world project, it is
practically impossible to have zero dependencies.

Armin Ronacher
[called](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/) for a
vibe shift among programmers and I think that this actually exists
already. Everyone I speak to on this topic has agreed that minimizing
dependencies is ideal.

Rust and JavaScript, with their incredibly minimal standard libraries,
[work against this
ideal](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-03-15-zig-rust-and-other-languages.html#standard-library). Go, Python, Java, and C# in contrast have
a decent standard library, which helps minimize the explosion of
transitive dependencies.

### Examples

I think the standard library should reasonably include:

- JSON, CSV, and Parquet support
- HTTP/2 support (which includes TLS, compression, random number generation, etc.)
- Support for asynchronous IO
- A logging abstraction
- A SQL client abstraction
- Key abstract data types (BTrees, hashmaps, sets, and growable arrays)
- Utilities for working with Unicode, time and timezones

But I don't think it needs to include:

- Excel support
- PostgreSQL or Oracle clients
- Flatbuffers support
- Niche data structures

Neither of these are intended to be complete lists, just examples.

### Walled gardens

Minimal standard libraries force growing companies to build out their
own internal collection of "standard libraries". As one example,
Bloomberg [did this](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde/wiki) with
C++. And I've heard of companies doing this already with Rust. This
allows larger companies to manage and minimize the explosion of
transitive dependencies over time.

All growing companies likely do something like this eventually. But
again, smaller standard libraries incentivize companies to build this
internal standard library earlier on. And the community benefits
relatively little from these internal standard libraries. The
community would benefit more if large organizations contributed back
to an actual standard library.

Smaller organizations do not have the capacity to build these internal
standard libraries.

Maybe the situation will lead to libraries like Boost for
JavaScript and Rust programmers. That could be fine.

### Versioning

A comprehensive standard library does not prevent the
language developers from releasing new versions of the standard
library. It is trivial to do this with naming like Go has done
with the [v2](https://go.dev/blog/v2-go-modules)
pattern. [math/rand/v2](https://go.dev/blog/randv2) is an example.

### Conclusion

I'm primarily thinking about maintainability, not security. You can
read about the [security
risks](https://medium.com/@john_25313/c-isnt-a-hangover-rust-isn-t-a-hangover-cure-580c9b35b5ce#:~:text=Rust%20makes%20it,for%20their%20libraries.)
of using a language with an ecosystem like Rust from someone who is an
expert on the matter.

My concern about the standard library does not stop me from using
Rust and JavaScript. They could choose to invest in the standard
library at any time. We have already begun to see
[Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3) and [Deno](https://jsr.io/@std)
to do exactly this. But it is clearly an area
for improvement in Rust and JavaScript. And a mistake for other
languages to avoid repeating.
