# Burn your title

I've been a developer, a manager, a cofounder, and now I'm a developer
again. I ran away from each position until being a founder because I
felt like I was limited by what I was allowed to do.

In bad (or at least unsupportive) organizations it might actually be
the case that you are reprimanded for doing things that you were not
asked to do. But reached a sort of enlightment during my career
progression that everyone around me was dying for someone to pick
things up, for employees to show engagement and agency.

I learned that titles largely reflect the limits we place on
ourselves. Trying to figure out what you must do to get promoted seems
kind of insane to me, or at least reinforces our sense of our own
limits. Instead, at every stage in your career, you focus on doing the
intersection of:

* what you see needs to be done
* what you are capable of doing
* what you have the desire/energy (or would find fulfillment) doing

And you're going to get promoted. That's it.

Burn your title. Burn your job description. I mean, keep your boss
happy for sure. Keep your teammates happy by supporting them and
building them up and communicating well. But don't ask to be made a
lead, just do whatever you see needs to be done.

And if after doing this, demonstrating this level of agency, you are
not promoted, it just means you're not at a good company or good
organization within your company and you should look elsewhere.

Here's a peak at what this looks like for me as an individual
contributor, a programmer, at EnterpriseDB.

I started the EDB Engineering Newsletter because it seemed like we
needed to do a better job telling the world the awesome things our
engineering team is doing. (You know we're one of the biggest
contributors to Postgres? Bruce Momjian, Robert Haas, Peter
Eisentraut, etc. work here? The guy who implemented the WAL and MVCC
in Postgres is my teammate?) Nobody asked me to do that.

I started publishing blog views for the entire company once a month
internally. Nobody asked me to do that.

I wrote a number of internal docs and tutorials on the product because
we were just obviously missing them. Nobody asked me to do that.

I started a fortnightly incident review meeting for my team because it
seemed like we were missing chances to update docs and teach each
other. Nobody asked me to do that.

Don't wait to be asked to do something. Do what is interesting and
obvious and rewarding to you.
