# Desktop applications, graphics stacks, and macOS linking

When tech companies build desktop apps, more and more it's Electron or
some other [webview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebView).

Spotify [ditched their native apps for
CEF](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/03/building-spotifys-new-web-player/). Slack
had [only ever been written as a webview
app.](https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/)
VS Code [is an Electron
app](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/adc51fb212867182d29d154b78bdaf42489b3c4d/src/main.js#L27). Discord
uses Electron.

Some major programming tools aren't webviews, but these feel like the
minority. JetBrains uses
[Swing](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/d626ed9534135c841b815b7d134b8216298a9dc3/java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/ide/projectWizard/ProjectCategory.java#L9). GTK
was built for GIMP and GIMP still uses it. Sublime is [built on
Skia](https://thume.ca/2016/12/03/disassembling-sublime-text/). Eclipse
is built on
[SWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit) which
under the hood may use GTK or other OS-specific libraries.

Open-source code tends to use GTK or QT or
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Open-source users normally
value time-to-result in GUIs, and the resulting performance, more so
than ability to sculpt the UI and UX. GTK and ImGui are easy to use
but seem to have limited customizability. QT is easy to use and highly
customizable but the license is only definitely friendly for
open-source users.

Tech companies wanting to build cross-platform apps seem to prefer to
high JavaScript developers and web designers (probably because there
are more of them and thus hiring is easier). So they stick with
webviews.

The rare company only interested in catering to macOS users may use
macOS specific UI code (like [OmniGroup selling
OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)).

Older companies may offer Windows-only products with Windows Forms
(WinForms), or offer cross-platform applications and with Java Swing
or JavaFX.

Obviously there are no rules here, but there seem to be patterns.

### Soul-searching

Chrome-based frameworks like CEF or Electron give you a lot. All your
knowledge with HTML and JavaScript and CSS transfers. You get to reuse
huge amounts of code between your web application and your desktop
application. Publishing steps (like code signing) on Windows and macOS
are well-documented.

The problem is that Chrome-based frameworks like CEF or Electron give
you a lot. These apps take huge amounts of RAM even when your
application isn't doing much. Being a memory hog isn't necessarily
intrinsic to using a webview, but it's common enough so as to be
something to consider.

In reality though most applications don't need an entire browser to
run. Most applications themselves aren't highly manipulatable.

The advantage of a browser is that it can run highly variable
workloads. But when your own application's workload likely isn't
highly variable. Most CRUD apps, form-based apps, and even many
developer tools don't need to be able to visualize and display
arbitrary user input.

So when you ship your application bundled as a webview you're shipping
at a layer of abstraction significantly above what is necessary.

Wasting user resources is not amazing UX. What options are there?

### Outside

GTK, Swing, and ImGui didn't seem flexible. JavaFX, QT, and Xamarin
had too high a learning curve. WinForms and SwiftUI/AppKit/UIKit are
not cross-platform.
