    <p>
      When looking at book recommendations it's often as useful to
      know what was not included as what was. I've read 225 books
      since
      I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11633-2023-reading-challenge">started
      keeping track</a> in 2016. These 11 books are the ones I can
      easily recommend, especially to professionals in tech.
