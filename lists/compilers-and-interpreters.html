    <h1>Favorite compiler and interpreter resources</h1>
    <h2>Last updated Jan 4, 2023</h2>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <p>
      My personal path, a hobbyist, (outside of a class on PL and a
      class on compilers I took before I dropped out) was focused at
      first on Brainfuck, Scheme, lower-case forth, and lower-case
      lisp interpreters. After I was confident there I moved on to
      minimal versions of Lua, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL and
      Go; varying between implementing AST interpreters, bytecode VMs
      and native-code compilers (via C, LLVM, and x86). Either using
      the language's first-party parser or implementing my own
      handwritten parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might wonder why so many PL/compiler resources focus on
      languages like lower-case lisp. Basically, parsing more common
      languages is more tedious because they have more syntax. So it
      takes you longer to get a working language implementation
      compared to the sparse syntax of a lisp (or a forth). Once you
      get the hang of it with a forth or lisp though it's easy to
      bring that skill to "normal" languages. Although you will then
      need to pick up a technique for handling operator precedence
      (discussed below).
    </p>

    <h3>More blind spots</h3>
    <p>
      I have never implemented garbage collection myself (at best I've
      hooked into the host language's GC, similar to using libgc). I
      haven't implemented register allocation since the college
      compilers course. I haven't implemented JIT compilation. I
      haven't spent very much time targeting Windows or macOS or
      anything other than Linux/x86_64.
    </p>

    <h3>Introductory</h3>
    <p>
      These helped me out and I think are reasonable to recommend to
      others. The list is not long because I have not explored that
      many broad introductory texts. And many that I did (listed
      further below) I really didn't like.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://norvig.com/lispy.html">Peter Norvig's Lisp in Python</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal">Make a lisp</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parsing (operator precedence)</h3>
    <p>
      First
      off, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/parser-generators-vs-handwritten-parsers-survey-2021.html">real
      world languages generally don't use parser
      generators</a>. Parser generators also harder to learn, and are
      another dependency and build step. So you can happily skip.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you still want to learn how to use a parser generator, look
      at Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/C/ML or at The Dragon
      Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can pick up the basics of handwritten parsers from the items
      in the Introductory section above. The major complex part
      remaining is operator precedence. Even though I've implemented
      it a few times, I need to go and look up an explanation again
      every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, look up <strong>Shunting Yard</strong>, <strong>Pratt
      Parsing</strong>, or <strong>Precedence Climbing</strong>. There
      were one or two pages that helped me out in particular but I
      can't find them at the moment.

      Andy Chu of Oil Shell has
      a <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/03/31.html">survey
      of various explanations</a> that you may find useful.

    <h3>Conspicuous books not on the list</h3>
    <p>
      As you dig further into compilers/interpreters maybe you want to
      check these out. I own them and try to browse them occasionally
      but overall I'm not a fan. If you like them, great!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</li>
      <li>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (aka "The Dragon Book")</li>
      <li>
	The Little Typer
	<p>
	  <small>
	    Notes: I know some people like it but boy do I abhor both
	    the style and content of this book. It is extremely
	    complicated and the whimsical style just makes me
	    angry. Maybe The Little Schemer is better since the topic
	    is less complex. I'm scared to try it.
	  </small>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	Modern Compiler Implementation in Java/ML/C
	<p>
	  <small>
	    Notes: This one was the text for the compilers course I
	    took in college and I loved that course. But ultimately
	    I'm not sure this book is as good as some other resources
	    listed above (in aggregate).
