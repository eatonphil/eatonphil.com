    <p>
      My basic requirement is that recipes don't require a lot of
      skill. They aren't all necessarily short though. Some require a lot
      of preparatory cutting unless you have a food processor (like
      latkes).
    </p>

    <h4>General notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a recipe that isn't supposed to be very garlic-y says to use a few cloves of garlic, always use a full head of garlic</li>
      <li>If a recipe is supposed to be garlic-y, use multiple heads of garlic (at least two)</li>
      <li>If a recipe calls for some amount of spinach or kale in a way that the greens get cooked and shrink, you can add 2-4 times the amount of greens and not taste a difference. You'll eat more greens. And greens in soup tend to hold soup flavor quite well.</li>
    </ul>

	<p>
	  <small>Notes: Use a lot of salt in the pasta water. Don't burn the oil you toast pepper in, but do let it toast for as long as possible (before burning).</small>

	<p>
	  <small>Notes: Use generous amount of sugar. The result won't be sweet but it better brings out the contrast with vinegar and spice.</small>

      <li>
	<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015533-classic-potato-latkes">Latkes</a>
	<p>
	  <small>Notes: Swap potatoes for any root vegetables (turnip, sweet potato, carrots, onions) for variety. Serve with sour cream, pickles, and/or apple sauce. Without these toppings you'll need to add more salt than you think or the latkes will be pretty bland.</small>

	<p>
	  <small>Notes: Keep the soup and bread separate so they can be stored easily. Serve bowl-at-a-time by dishing soup into a bowl, covering with one or two pieces of bread, topping with generous amount of sliced Gruyere/Emmental/Jarlsberg or (American) Swiss cheese and microwave for a minute or two until the cheese melts.</small>

	<p>
	  <small>Notes: Unlike many recipes here the flavor in this dish is not extremely strong. But it's still a good dish. Make sure to use feta stored in a brine.</small>
