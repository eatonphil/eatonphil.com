  <li>[Eli Bendersky's eli.thegreenplace.net](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/): Seems like he's covered every topic in CS. Some of my favorite of his are on [Raft](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/), [JIT-compiling](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2013/11/05/how-to-jit-an-introduction), and [operator precedence parsing](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/01/02/top-down-operator-precedence-parsing).</li>
