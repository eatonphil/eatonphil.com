  My basic requirement is that recipes don't require a lot of
  skill. They aren't all necessarily short though. Some require a lot
  of preparatory cutting unless you have a food processor (like
  latkes).
</p>

<h4>General notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If a recipe that isn't supposed to be very garlic-y says to use a few cloves of garlic, always use a full head of garlic</li>
  <li>If a recipe is supposed to be garlic-y, use multiple heads of garlic (at least two)</li>
  <li>If a recipe calls for some amount of spinach or kale in a way that the greens get cooked and shrink, you can add 2-4 times the amount of greens and not taste a difference. You'll eat more greens. And greens in soup tend to hold soup flavor quite well.</li>
</ul>

      <small>Notes: Use a lot of salt in the pasta water. Don't burn the oil you toast pepper in, but do let it toast for as long as possible (before burning).</small>

    <p>
      <small>Notes: Swap potatoes for any root vegetables (turnip, sweet potato, carrots, onions) for variety. Serve with sour cream, pickles, and/or apple sauce. Without these toppings you'll need to add more salt than you think or the latkes will be pretty bland.</small>

      <small>Notes: Keep the soup and bread separate so they can be stored easily. Serve bowl-at-a-time by dishing soup into a bowl, covering with one or two pieces of bread, topping with generous amount of sliced Gruyere/Emmental/Jarlsberg or (American) Swiss cheese and microwave for a minute or two until the cheese melts.</small>
