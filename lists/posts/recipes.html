  My basic requirement is that recipes don't require a lot of
  skill. They aren't all necessarily short though. Some require a lot
  of preparatory cutting unless you have a food processor (like
  latkes).
</p>

### General notes

<ul>
  <li>If a recipe that isn't supposed to be very garlic-y says to use a few cloves of garlic, always use a full head of garlic</li>
  <li>If a recipe is supposed to be garlic-y, use multiple heads of garlic (at least two)</li>
  <li>If a recipe calls for some amount of spinach or kale in a way that the greens get cooked and shrink, you can add 2-4 times the amount of greens and not taste a difference. You'll eat more greens. And greens in soup tend to hold soup flavor quite well.</li>
</ul>

#### Cacio e Pepe

<p>
  Generously salt the pasta water. Don't burn the oil you toast pepper
  in, but do let it toast for as long as possible (before burning).

#### Creamy Tuscan Chicken

<p>
   Use two bunches or boxes of spinach. There's never enough spinach.

#### Spicy Cabbage Stir Fry

<p>
  Use generous amount of sugar. The result won't be sweet but it better brings out the contrast with vinegar and spice.

#### Latkes

<p>
  Swap potatoes for any root vegetables (turnip, sweet potato, carrots, onions) for variety. Serve with sour cream, pickles, and/or apple sauce. Without these toppings you'll need to add more salt than you think or the latkes will be pretty bland.

#### French Onion Soup

<p>
  Keep the soup and bread separate so they can be stored
  easily. Serve bowl-at-a-time by dishing soup into a bowl, covering
  with one or two pieces of bread, topping with generous amount of
  sliced Gruyere/Emmental/Jarlsberg or (American) Swiss cheese and
  microwave for a minute or two until the cheese melts.
