<h3>Parks with potential</h3>
<p>
  These parks are somewhat rundown but have great potential if they were better funded.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park">Flushing Meadow Corona Park</a>
    <p>Notes: The area around the lake floods constantly and has extremely few bathrooms. It's more fun during the summer when it's dry and you can watch 10s of soccer games going on, tons of cricket games too. Do the fountains at the Unisphere or the Fountain of the Planets ever work?</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/10388">Flushing Bay Promenade</a>
    <p>Notes: I guess it's a part of Flushing Meadow Corona Park. Similar to FMCP, it does not seem to get enough love (funding).
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q015/">Forest Park</a>
    <p>Notes: Overrated and unfortunately feels slightly rundown. Still nice to visit during the day but would be great if they could remove or replace all the broken light fixtures throughout the park.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
