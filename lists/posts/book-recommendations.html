<p>
  When looking at book recommendations it's often as useful to know
  what was not included as what was. I've read 275 books since
  I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11633-2023-reading-challenge">started
  keeping track</a> in 2016. These 16 books I easily recommend,
  especially to professionals in tech.
